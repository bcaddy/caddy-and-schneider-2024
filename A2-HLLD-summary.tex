\section{HLLD Summary}
\label{sec:hlld}

I have this written up \href{https://robertcaddy.com/posts/HLLD-Algorithm/}{here} but haven't decided if I'll include it. I really want to include the VL+CT stuff since it's not really well spelled out in the series of Athena papers but the HLLD paper is pretty clear, if a bit out of order for implementing.
