	abstract = {We describe a numerical algorithm based on Godunov methods for integrating the equations of compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in multidimensions. It combines a simple, dimensionally-unsplit integration method with the constrained transport (CT) discretization of the induction equation to enforce the divergence-free constraint. We present the results of a series of fully three-dimensional tests which indicate the method is second-order accurate for smooth solutions in all MHD wave families, and captures shocks, contact and rotational discontinuities well. However, it is also more diffusive than other more complex unsplit integrators combined with CT. Thus, the primary advantage of the method is its simplicity. It does not require a characteristic tracing step to construct interface values for the Riemann solver, it is straightforward to extend with additional physics, and it is suitable for use with nested and adaptive meshes. The method is implemented as one of two dimensionally unsplit MHD integrators in the Athena code, which is freely available for download from the web. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A new code for astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is described. The code has been designed to be easily extensible for use with static and adaptive mesh refinement. It combines higher order Godunov methods with the constrained transport (CT) technique to enforce the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field. Discretization is based on cell-centered volume averages for mass, momentum, and energy, and face-centered area averages for the magnetic field. Novel features of the algorithm include (1) a consistent framework for computing the time-and edge-averaged electric fields used by CT to evolve the magnetic field from the time-and area-averaged Godunov fluxes, (2) the extension to MHD of spatial reconstruction schemes that involve a dimensionally split time advance, and (3) the extension to MHD of two different dimensionally unsplit integration methods. Implementation of the algorithm in both C and FORTRAN95 is detailed, including strategies for parallelization using domain decomposition. Results from a test suite which includes problems in one-, two-, and three-dimensions for both hydrodynamics and MHD are given, not only to demonstrate the fidelity of the algorithms, but also to enable comparisons to other methods.

We use these relationships to derive new algorithms for constructing the CT fluxes at grid cell corners which reduce exactly to the equivalent one-dimensional solver for plane-parallel, grid-aligned flow. We show that the PPM reconstruction algorithm must include multidimensional terms for MHD, and we describe a number of important extensions that must be made to CTU in order for it to be used for MHD with CT.

It is intended primarily for applications in astrophysical ﬂuid dynamics, but its ﬂexible and modular design enables its use for a wide variety of physics. The framework works with both uniform and nonuniform grids in Cartesian and curvilinear coordinate systems. It adopts a dynamic execution model based on a simple design called a “task list” that improves parallel performance by overlapping communication and computation, simpliﬁes the inclusion of a diverse range of physics, and even enables multiphysics models involving different physics in different regions of the calculation. We describe physics modules implemented in this framework for both nonrelativistic and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). These modules adopt mature and robust algorithms originally developed for the Athena MHD code and incorporate new extensions: support for curvilinear coordinates, higherorder time integrators, more realistic physics such as a general equation of state, and diffusion terms that can be integrated with super-time-stepping algorithms. The modules show excellent performance and scaling, with well over 80\% parallel efﬁciency on over half a million threads. The source code has been made publicly available.},

	abstract = {A new multi-state Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL) approximate Riemann solver for the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations is developed based on the assumption that the normal velocity is constant over the Riemann fan. This assumption is same as that used in the HLLC ("C" denotes Contact) approximate Riemann solver for the Euler equations. From the assumption, it is naturally derived that the Riemann fan should consist of four intermediate states for Bx ≠ 0, whereas the number of the intermediate states is reduced to two when Bx = 0. Since the intermediate states satisfied with all jump conditions in this approximate Riemann system are analytically obtained, the multi-state HLL Riemann solver can be constructed straightforwardly. It is shown that this solver can exactly resolve isolated discontinuities formed in the MHD system, and hence named as HLLD Riemann solver. (Here, "D" stands for Discontinuities.) It is also analytically proved that the HLLD Riemann solver is positively conservative like the HLLC Riemann solver. Indeed, the HLLD Riemann solver corresponds to the HLLC Riemann solver when the magnetic field vanishes. Numerical tests demonstrate that the HLLD Riemann solver is more robust and efficient than the linearized Riemann solver, and its resolution is equally good. It indicates that the HLLD solver must be useful in practical applications for the ideal MHD equations. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Recently, upwind differencing schemes have become very popular for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations, especially when discontinuities exist in the solutions. Among many upwind schemes successfully applied to rhe problems in gas dynamics, Roe's method stands out for its relative simplicity and clarity of the underlying physical model. In this paper, an upwind differencing scheme of Roe-type for the MHD equations is constructed. In each computational cell, the problem is first linearized around some averaged state which preserves the flux differences. Then the solution is advanced in time by computing the wave contributions to the flux at the cell interfaces. One crucial task of the linearization procedure is the construction of a Roe matrix. For the special case {\textgreater}J = 2, a Roe matrix in the form of a mean value Jacobian is found, and for the general case, a simple averaging procedure is introduced. All other necessary ingredients of the construction, which include eigenvalues, and a complete set of right eigenvectors of the Roe matrix and decomposition coefficients are presented. As a numerical example, we chose a coplanar MHD Riemann problem. The problem is solved by the newly constructed second-order upwind scheme as well as by the Lax Friedrichs, the Lax-Wendroff, and the flux-corrected transport schemes. The results demonstrate several advantages of the upwind scheme. In this paper, we also show that the MHD equations are nonconvex. This is a contrast to the general belief that the fast and slow waves are like sound waves in the Euler equations. As a consequence, the wave structure becomes more complicated; for example, compound waves consisting of a shock and attached to it a rarefaction wave of the same family can exist in MHD.},

The algorithm is based on the full 12-solve spatially unsplit corner-transport-upwind (CTU) scheme. The fluid quantities are cell-centered and are updated using the piecewise-parabolic method (PPM), while the magnetic field variables are face-centered and are evolved through application of the Stokes theorem on cell edges via a constrained-transport (CT) method. The so-called multidimensional MHD source terms required in the predictor step for high-order accuracy are applied in a simplified form which reduces their complexity in three dimensions without loss of accuracy or robustness. The algorithm is implemented on an AMR framework which requires specific synchronization steps across refinement levels. These include face-centered restriction and prolongation operations and a reflux-curl operation, which maintains a solenoidal magnetic field across refinement boundaries. The code is tested against a large suite of test problems, including convergence tests in smooth flows, shock-tube tests, classical two- and three-dimensional MHD tests, a three-dimensional shock-cloud interaction problem, and the formation of a cluster of galaxies in a fully cosmological context.

Cholla models the Euler equations on a static mesh using state-of-the-art techniques, including the unsplit Corner Transport Upwind algorithm, a variety of exact and approximate Riemann solvers, and multiple spatial reconstruction techniques including the piecewise parabolic method (PPM). Using GPUs, Cholla evolves the fluid properties of thousands of cells simultaneously and can update over 10 million cells per GPU-second while using an exact Riemann solver and PPM reconstruction. Owing to the massively parallel architecture of GPUs and the design of the Cholla code, astrophysical simulations with physically interesting grid resolutions (2563) can easily be computed on a single device. We use the Message Passing Interface library to extend calculations onto multiple devices and demonstrate nearly ideal scaling beyond 64 GPUs. A suite of test problems highlights the physical accuracy of our modeling and provides a useful comparison to other codes. We then use Cholla to simulate the interaction of a shock wave with a gas cloud in the interstellar medium, showing that the evolution of the cloud is highly dependent on its density structure. We reconcile the computed mixing time of a turbulent cloud with a realistic density distribution destroyed by a strong shock with the existing analytic theory for spherical cloud destruction by describing the system in terms of its median gas density.},

	abstract = {The nonlinear evolution of monochromatic large-amplitude circularly polarized Alfv´en waves subject to the decay instability is studied via numerical simulations in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. The asymptotic value of the cross helicity depends strongly on the plasma beta: in the low beta case multiple decays are observed, with about half of the energy being transferred to waves propagating in the opposite direction at lower wave numbers, for each saturation step. Correspondingly, the other half of the total transverse energy (kinetic and magnetic) goes into energy carried by the daughter compressive waves and to the associated shock heating. In higher beta conditions we ﬁnd instead that the cross helicity decreases monotonically with time towards zero, implying an asymptotic balance between inward and outward Alfv´enic modes, a feature similar to the observed decrease with distance in the solar wind. Although the instability mainly takes place along the propagation direction, in the two and three-dimensional case a turbulent cascade occurs also transverse to the ﬁeld. The asymptotic state of density ﬂuctuations appears to be rather isotropic, whereas a slight preferential cascade in the transverse direction is seen in magnetic ﬁeld spectra. Finally, parametric decay is shown to occur also in a non-periodic domain with open boundaries, when the mother wave is continuously injected from one side. In two and three dimensions a strong transverse ﬁlamentation is found at long times, reminiscent of density ray-like features observed in the extended solar corona and pressure-balanced structures found in solar wind data.},

    abstract="A general tool for solving MHD and hydrodynamical problems typical of astrophysical applications is designed and implemented. The code allows the user to solve a hyperbolic system of partial differential equations with a variety of modern high resolution numerical schemes on 1, 2 or 3D non-uniform Cartesian grids with slab or axial symmetry. The equations may contain fluxes and source terms. The boundary conditions can be chosen from a number of implemented types, --- fixed, periodic, reflective or `free' --- but the code is structured in a manner that allows the user to write his/her own subroutines for a new type of boundary condition, or even to implement a new set of equations. The choice of algorithms allows the user to find the optimal one for the application at hand and/or to compare results of different schemes thus gaining insight into the numerical effects. An emphasis is put on independence of computer platforms. Efficiency of the code is also a high priority, the options available for the user should not compromise the performance.",

	abstract = {Motivated by observations of multiphase galaxy outﬂows, we explore the impact of isotropic and anisotropic electron thermal conduction on the evolution of radiatively cooled, cold clouds embedded in hot, magnetized winds. Using the adaptive-mesh reﬁnement code ATHENAPK, we conduct simulations of clouds impacted by supersonic and transonic ﬂows with magnetic ﬁelds initially aligned parallel and perpendicular to the ﬂow direction. In cases with isotropic thermal conduction, an evaporative wind forms, stabilizing against instabilities and leading to a mass-loss rate that matches the hydrodynamic case. In anisotropic cases, the impact of conduction is more limited and strongly dependent on the ﬁeld orientation. In runs with initially perpendicular ﬁelds, the ﬁeld lines are folded back into the tail, strongly limiting conduction, but magnetic ﬁelds act to dampen instabilities and slow the stretching of the cloud in the ﬂow direction. In the parallel case, anisotropic conduction aids cloud survival by forming a radiative wind near the front of the cloud, which suppresses instabilities and reduces mass loss. In all cases, anisotropic conduction has a minimal impact on the acceleration of the cloud.},

	abstract = {General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations have revolutionized our understanding of black hole accretion. Here, we present a GPU-accelerated GRMHD code H-AMR with multifaceted optimizations that, collectively, accelerate computation by 2–5 orders of magnitude for a wide range of applications. First, it introduces a spherical grid with 3D adaptive mesh reﬁnement that operates in each of the three dimensions independently. This allows us to circumvent the Courant condition near the polar singularity, which otherwise cripples high-resolution computational performance. Second, we demonstrate that local adaptive time stepping on a logarithmic spherical-polar grid accelerates computation by a factor of 10 compared to traditional hierarchical time-stepping approaches. Jointly, these unique features lead to an effective speed of ∼109 zone cycles per second per node on 5400 NVIDIA V100 GPUs (i.e., 900 nodes of the OLCF Summit supercomputer). We illustrate H-AMRʼs computational performance by presenting the ﬁrst GRMHD simulation of a tilted thin accretion disk threaded by a toroidal magnetic ﬁeld around a rapidly spinning black hole. With an effective resolution of 13,440 × 4608 × 8092 cells and a total of 22 billion cells and ∼0.65 × 108 time steps, it is among the largest astrophysical simulations ever performed. We ﬁnd that frame dragging by the black hole tears up the disk into two independently precessing subdisks. The innermost subdisk rotation axis intermittently aligns with the black hole spin, demonstrating for the ﬁrst time that such long-sought alignment is possible in the absence of large-scale poloidal magnetic ﬁelds.},

	abstract = {On the path to exascale the landscape of computer device architectures and corresponding programming models has become much more diverse. While various low-level performance portable programming models are available, support at the application level lacks behind. To address this issue, we present the performance portable block-structured adaptive mesh reﬁnement (AMR) framework PARTHENON, derived from the well-tested and widely used ATHENA++ astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics code, but generalized to serve as the foundation for a variety of downstream multi-physics codes. PARTHENON adopts the KOKKOS programming model, and provides various levels of abstractions from multi-dimensional variables, to packages deﬁning and separating components, to launching of parallel compute kernels. PARTHENON allocates all data in device memory to reduce data movement, supports the logical packing of variables and mesh blocks to reduce kernel launch overhead, and employs one-sided, asynchronous MPI calls to reduce communication overhead in multi-node simulations. Using a hydrodynamics miniapp, we demonstrate weak and strong scaling on various architectures including AMD and NVIDIA GPUs, Intel and AMD x86 CPUs, IBM Power9 CPUs, as well as Fujitsu A64FX CPUs. At the largest scale on Frontier (the ﬁrst TOP500 exascale machine), the miniapp reaches a total of 1.7 × 1013 zone-cycles/s on 9,216 nodes (73,728 logical GPUs) at ≈ 92\% weak scaling parallel efﬁciency (starting from a single node). In combination with being an open, collaborative project, this makes PARTHENON an ideal framework to target exascale simulations in which the downstream developers can focus on their speciﬁc application rather than on the complexity of handling massively-parallel, device-accelerated AMR.},

	abstract = {The Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) has been preparing the nation’s first exascale system, Frontier, for production and end users. Frontier is based on HPE Cray’s new EX architecture and Slingshot interconnect and features 74 cabinets of optimized 3rd Gen AMD EPYC CPUs for HPC and AI and AMD Instinct 250X accelerators. As a part of this preparation, “real-world” user codes have been selected to help assess the functionality, performance, and usability of the system. This paper describes early experiences using the system in collaboration with the Hamburg Observatory for two selected codes, which have since been adopted in the OLCF Test Harness. Experiences discussed include efforts to resolve performance variability and per-cycle slowdowns. Results are shown for a performance portable astrophysical magnetohydronamics code, AthenaPK, and a mini-application stressing the core functionality of a performance portable block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework, Parthenon-Hydro. These results show good scaling characteristics to the full system. At the largest scale, the Parthenon-Hydro miniapp reaches a total of 1.7 × 1013 zone-cycles/s on 9,216 nodes (73,728 logical GPUs) at ≈ 92\% weak scaling parallel efficiency (starting from a single node using a second-order, finite-volume method).},

	abstract = {We discuss an optimal strategy for treating the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) field transport (induction) equation. The induction equation is shown to assume its simplest form when written in terms of the contravariant forms of velocity and magnetic vector density. The approach places the induction equation in integral form and uses the magnetic flux as a fundamental variable. We describe a new numerical technique, called constrained transport (CT), for evolving the induction equation in a way that maintains vanishing divergence of the poloidal (constrained) field components to within machine round-off error. The scheme places no restrictions on the order of accuracy of the transport technique and is shown to work in three dimensions as well as in two. We show that CT allows incorporation of an adaptive mesh algorithm in a natural way. No barrier is evident to prevent the use of the technique in nonideal MHD simulations. Some past treatments of the MHD induction equation are reviewed, with attention to the question of constraint satisfaction. We show how the 3 + 1 formalism of numerical relativity can be used to express the general relativistic MHD equations in a form suitable for numerical evolution. The relativistic form of the magnetic induction equation is then shown to fit naturally within the CT scheme. An axisymmetric, two-dimensional finite-difference code has been constructed incorporating the new method for the induction equation. Results obtained using the CT method are compared with those obtained from a code employing vector potential evolution. Several models involving magnetized flow near a black hole are used as calibrations of the CT scheme.},

Here, we analyse the magnetic ﬁeld in the CGM of the Milky Way-like galaxies simulated as part of the AURIGA project that constitutes a set of high-resolution cosmological magnetohydrodynamical zoom simulations. We show that before z = 1 the CGM becomes magnetized via galactic outﬂows that transport magnetized gas from the disc into the halo. At this time, the magnetization of the CGM closely follows its metal enrichment. We then show that at low redshift an in situ turbulent dynamo that operates on a time-scale of Gigayears further ampliﬁes the magnetic ﬁeld in the CGM and saturates before z = 0. The magnetic ﬁeld strength reaches a typical value of 0.1 μG at the virial radius at z = 0 and becomes mostly uniform within the virial radius. Its Faraday rotation signal is in excellent agreement with recent observations. For most of its evolution, the magnetic ﬁeld in the CGM is an unordered small-scale ﬁeld. Only strong coherent outﬂows at low redshift are able to order the magnetic ﬁeld in parts of the CGM that are directly displaced by these outﬂows.},

	abstract = {The formation of molecular clouds out of Hi gas is the first step toward star formation. Its metallicity dependence plays a key role to determine star formation through the cosmic history. Previous theoretical studies with detailed chemical networks calculate thermal equilibrium states and/or thermal evolution under one-zone collapsing background. The molecular cloud formation in reality, however, involves supersonic flows, and thus resolving the cloud internal turbulence/density structure in three dimension is still essential. We here perform magnetohydrodynamics simulations of 20 km s−1 converging flows of Warm Neutral Medium (WNM) with 1 µG mean magnetic field in the metallicity range from the Solar (1.0 Z⊙) to 0.2 Z⊙ environment. The Cold Neutral Medium (CNM) clumps form faster with higher metallicity due to more efficient cooling. Meanwhile, their mass functions commonly follow dn/dm ∝ m−1.7 at three cooling times regardless of the metallicity. Their total turbulence power also commonly shows the Kolmogorov spectrum with its 80 percent in the solenoidal mode, while the CNM volume alone indicates the transition towards the Larson’s law. These similarities measured at the same time in the unit of the cooling time suggest that the molecular cloud formation directly from the WNM alone requires a longer physical time in a lower metallicity environment in the 1.0–0.2 Z⊙ range. To explain the rapid formation of molecular clouds and subsequent massive star formation possibly within ≲ 10 Myr as observed in the Large/Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC/SMC), the Hi gas already contains CNM volume instead of pure WNM.},

Their structures and properties on macroscale have been interpreted successfully by the generally-accepted two-dimension standard model invoking magnetic reconnection theory as the key energy conversion mechanism. Nevertheless, some momentous dynamical features as discovered by recent high-resolution observations remain elusive. Here, we report a self-consistent high-resolution three-dimension magnetohydrodynamical simulation of turbulent magnetic reconnection within a ﬂare current sheet. It is found that fragmented current patches of diﬀerent scales are spontaneously generated with a well-developed turbulence spectrum at the current sheet, as well as at the ﬂare loop-top region. The close coupling of tearing-mode and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities plays a critical role in developing turbulent reconnection and in forming dynamical structures with synthetic observables in good agreement with realistic observations. The sophisticated modeling makes a paradigm shift from the traditional to three-dimension turbulent reconnection model unifying ﬂare dynamical structures of diﬀerent scales.},

Rotation of the BH drags the surrounding space-time, manifesting as LenseThirring torques that lead to disk precession and warping. We study these processes by simulating a thin (H/r = 0.02), highly tilted (T = 65◦) accretion disk around a rapidly rotating (a = 0.9375) BH at extremely high resolutions, which we performed using the general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) code H-AMR. The disk becomes significantly warped and continuously tears into two individually precessing subdisks. We find that mass accretion rates far exceed the standard α-viscosity expectations. We identify two novel dissipation mechanisms specific to warped disks that are the main drivers of accretion, distinct from the local turbulent stresses that are usually thought to drive accretion. In particular, we identify extreme scale height oscillations that occur twice an orbit throughout our disk. When the scale height compresses, ‘nozzle’ shocks form, dissipating orbital energy and driving accretion. Separate from this phenomenon, there is also extreme dissipation at the location of the tear. This leads to the formation of low-angular momentum ‘streamers’ that rain down onto the inner sub-disk, shocking it. The addition of low angular momentum gas to the inner sub-disk causes it to rapidly accrete, even when it is transiently aligned with the BH spin and thus unwarped. These mechanisms, if general, significantly modify the standard accretion paradigm. Additionally, they may drive structural changes on much shorter timescales than expected in α-disks, potentially explaining some of the extreme variability observed in active galactic nuclei.},

More specifically, the magnetic angular momentum transport (AMT) plays a dominant role in the calculations. We examine the important spatial scales for the magnetic AMT. The main conclusions of our approach can be summarized as follows: 1. Turbulence transports the angular momentum radially inward. This effect is more pronounced in the highest resolution calculation. 2. The dominant scale for the magnetic AMT is the smallest spatial scale. 3. The dimensionless magnetic correlation is low in the high-resolution simulation. Thus, chaotic but strong small-scale magnetic fields achieve efficient magnetic AMT.},

	abstract = {Cosmic rays (CRs) are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium (ISM) of nearby galaxies, but many of their properties are not well-constrained. Gamma-ray observations provide a powerful tool in this respect, allowing us to constrain both the interaction of CR protons with the ISM and their transport properties. To help better understand the link between observational signatures and CR physics, we use a series of magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) AREPO simulations of isolated galaxies performed using spectrally-resolved CR transport in every computational cell, with subsequent gamma-ray emission calculated using the CRAYON+ (Cosmic RAY emissiON) code. In each of our simulated halos, modelling the energy-dependent spatial diffusion of CRs leads to a more extended distribution of high-energy ({\textasciitilde}100 GeV) gamma rays compared to that predicted by a 'grey' steady-state model, which is especially visible in the corresponding emission maps and radial profiles. Despite this, the total gamma-ray spectra can often be well approximated by the steady-state model, although recovering the same spectral index typically requires a minor variation of the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient. Our simulations reproduce the observed spectral indices and gamma-ray spectra of nearby star-forming galaxies and also match recent observations of the far infrared--gamma-ray relation. We find, however, that the spectrally resolved model yields marginally smaller luminosities for lower star formation rates compared to grey simulations of CRs. Our work highlights the importance of modelling spectrally resolved CR transport for an accurate prediction of spatially resolved high-energy gamma-ray emission, as will be probed by the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array observatory.},

	abstract = {The theoretical prediction that magnetic reconnection spontaneously drives turbulence has been supported by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and kinetic simulations. While reconnection with externally driven turbulence is accepted as an effective mechanism for particle acceleration, the acceleration during the reconnection with self-driven turbulence is studied for the first time in this work. By using high-resolution 3D MHD simulations of reconnection with self-generated turbulence, we inject test particles into the reconnection layer to study their acceleration process. We find that the energy gain of the particles takes place when they bounce back and forth between converging turbulent magnetic fields. The particles can be efficiently accelerated in self-driven turbulent reconnection with the energy increase by about 3 orders of magnitude in the range of the box size. The acceleration proceeds when the particle gyroradii become larger than the thickness of the reconnection layer. We find that the acceleration in the direction perpendicular to the local magnetic field dominates over that in the parallel direction. The energy spectrum of accelerated particles is time-dependent with a slope that evolves toward -2.5. Our findings can have important implications for particle acceleration in high-energy astrophysical environments.},

	abstract = {We present a first 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of oxygen, neon and carbon shell burning in a rapidly rotating 16 M\_sun core-collapse supernova progenitor. We also run a purely hydrodynamic simulation for comparison. After 180s (15 and 7 convective turnovers respectively), the magnetic fields in the oxygen and neon shells achieve saturation at 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}G and 5 x 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}G. The strong Maxwell stresses become comparable to the radial Reynolds stresses and eventually suppress convection. The suppression of mixing by convection and shear instabilities results in the depletion of fuel at the base of the burning regions, so that the burning shell eventually move outward to cooler regions, thus reducing the energy generation rate. The strong magnetic fields efficiently transport angular momentum outwards, quickly spinning down the rapidly rotating convective oxygen and neon shells and forcing them into rigid rotation. The hydrodynamic model shows complicated redistribution of angular momentum and develops regions of retrograde rotation at the base of the convective shells. We discuss implications of our results for stellar evolution and for the subsequent core-collapse supernova. The rapid redistribution of angular momentum in the MHD model casts some doubt on the possibility of retaining significant core angular momentum for explosions driven by millisecond magnetars. However, findings from multi-D models remain tentative until stellar evolution calculations can provide more consistent rotation profiles and estimates of magnetic field strengths to initialise multi-D simulations without substantial numerical transients. We also stress the need for longer simulations, resolution studies, and an investigation of non-ideal effects.},

For the first time in a numerical simulation, we present model cluster atmospheres based upon the Universal Pressure Profile (UPP), incorporating a temperature profile for a ‘typical’ self-similar atmosphere described by only one parameter ��500. We explore a comprehensive range of realistic atmospheres and jet powers and derive dynamic, energetic and polarimetric data which provide insight into what we should expect of future high-resolution studies of AGN outflows. From the simulated synchrotron emission maps which include Doppler beaming we find sidedness distributions that agree well with observations. We replicated a number of findings from our previous work, such as higher power jets inflating larger aspect-ratio lobes and the cluster environment impacting the distribution of energy between the lobe and shocked regions. Comparing UPP and ��-profiles we find that the cluster model chosen results in a different morphology for the resultant lobes with the UPP more able to clear lobe material from the core; and that these different atmospheres influence the ratio between the various forms of energy in the fully developed lobes. This work also highlights the key role played by Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instabilities in the formation of realistic lobe aspect-ratios. Our simulations point to the need for additional lobe-widening mechanisms at high jet powers, for example jet precession. Given that the UPP is our most representative general cluster atmosphere, these numerical simulations represent the most realistic models yet for spherically symmetric atmospheres.},

A time stationary global heliosphere is ﬁrst reproduced by using a high-resolution MHD simulation. Then, motions of a number of test particles (protons) distributed in the virtual heliosphere are numerically solved. When the initial particle Lorentz factor is 10 (∼10 GeV), the motions of particles are strongly affected by smallscale heliospheric structures reﬂecting the small gyroradii of the particles. Particles can enter the heliosphere from many parts (nose, ﬂank, and tail) of the heliopause. Once they have entered, they expand in the region where the magnetic ﬁeld is locally weak, such as the heliopause and the heliospheric current sheet. On the other hand, particles have difﬁculty invading upstream of the termination shock. We found a variety of invading particle trajectory patterns such as current sheet drift, polar drift, spiral motion, shock drift, and Fermi-like acceleration. In the latter two, particles are accelerated. When the initial particle Lorentz factor is 1000 (∼1 TeV), the particles are insensitive to the small-scale structures of the heliosphere due to their large gyroradii. Some particles show eccentric motions due to resonant interaction with the large-scale eddy in the heliotail. Some other particles passing by the heliosphere are mirror reﬂected due to the bottleneck structure of interstellar magnetic ﬁeld surrounding the heliosphere and return back to enter the heliosphere.},

	abstract = {Massive, young stars are the main source of energy that maintains multiphase structure and turbulence in the interstellar medium (ISM), and without this “feedback” the star formation rate (SFR) would be much higher than is observed. Rapid energy loss in the ISM and eﬃcient energy recovery by stellar feedback lead to co-regulation of SFRs and the ISM state. Realistic approaches to this problem should solve for the dynamical evolution of the ISM, including star formation, and the input of feedback energy self-consistently and accurately. Here, we present the TIGRESS-NCR numerical framework, in which UV radiation, supernovae, cooling and heating processes, and gravitational collapse are modeled explicitly. We use an adaptive ray tracing method for UV radiation transfer from star clusters represented by sink particles, accounting for attenuation by dust and gas. We solve photon-driven chemical equations to determine the abundances of H (time-dependent) and C/O-bearing species (steady-state), which then set cooling and heating rates self-consistently. Applying these methods, we present highresolution magnetohydrodynamics simulations of diﬀerentially rotating local galactic disks representing typical conditions of nearby star-forming galaxies. We analyze ISM properties and phase distributions and show good agreement with existing multiwavelength galactic observations. We measure midplane pressure components (turbulent, thermal, and magnetic) and the weight, demonstrating that vertical dynamical equilibrium holds. We quantify the ratios of pressure components to the SFR surface density, which we call the feedback yields. The TIGRESS-NCR framework will allow for a wide range of parameter exploration, including in low metallicity systems.},

In this work, we focus on the impact of supernovae on individual clouds, using a high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamic simulation of a region of 250 pc where we resolve the formation of individual massive stars. The supernova feedback is implemented with real supernovae, meaning supernovae that are the natural evolution of the resolved massive stars, so their position and timing are self-consistent. We select a large sample of molecular clouds from the simulation to investigate the supernova energy injection and the resulting properties of molecular clouds. We ﬁnd that molecular clouds have a lifetime of a few dynamical times, less then half of them contract to the point of becoming gravitationally bound, and the dispersal time of bound clouds of order one dynamical time is a factor of two shorter than that of unbound clouds. We stress the importance of internal supernovae, that is massive stars that explode inside their parent cloud, in setting the cloud dispersal time, and their huge overdensity compared to models where the supernovae are randomly distributed. We also quantify the energy injection eﬃciency of supernovae as a function of supernova distance to the clouds. We conclude that intermittent driving by supernovae can maintain molecular cloud turbulence and may be the main process of cloud dispersal, and that the full role of supernovae in the evolution of molecular clouds cannot be fully accounted for without a self-consistent implementation of the supernova feedback.},

It has recently been argued that the PDF of molecular clouds is a pure power-law distribution. It has been claimed that the log-normal part is ruled out when using only the part of the PDF up/down to which it is complete, that is where the column density contours are still closed. By using the results from high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical simulations of molecular cloud formation and evolution, we ﬁnd that the column density PDF is indeed composed of a log-normal and, if including self-gravity, a power-law part. We show that insuﬃcient sampling of a molecular cloud results in closed contours that cut oﬀ the log-normal part. In contrast, systematically increasing the ﬁeld of view and sampling the entire cloud yields a completeness limit at the lower column densities, which also recovers the log-normal part. This demonstrates that the ﬁeld of view must be suﬃciently large for the PDF to be complete down to its log-normal part, which has important implications for predictions of star-formation activity based on the PDF.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07757},
	abstract = {Turbulence in a conducting plasma can amplify seed magnetic fields in what is known as the turbulent, or small-scale, dynamo. The associated growth rate and emergent magnetic-field geometry depend sensitively on the material properties of the plasma, in particular on the Reynolds number \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Re\}\$, the magnetic Reynolds number \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Rm\}\$, and their ratio \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Pm\}{\textbackslash}equiv\{{\textbackslash}rm Rm\}/\{{\textbackslash}rm Re\}\$. For \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Pm\} {\textgreater} 1\$, the amplified magnetic field is gradually arranged into a folded structure, with direction reversals at the resistive scale and field lines curved at the larger scale of the flow. As the mean magnetic energy grows to come into approximate equipartition with the fluid motions, this folded structure is thought to persist. Using analytical theory and high-resolution MHD simulations with the Athena++ code, we show that these magnetic folds become unstable to tearing during the nonlinear stage of the dynamo for \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Rm\}{\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}4\$ and \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Re\}{\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}3\$. An \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Rm\}\$- and \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Pm\}\$-dependent tearing scale, at and below which folds are disrupted, is predicted theoretically and found to match well the characteristic field-reversal scale measured in the simulations. The disruption of folds by tearing increases the ratio of viscous-to-resistive dissipation. In the saturated state, the magnetic-energy spectrum exhibits a sub-tearing-scale steepening to a slope consistent with that predicted for tearing-mediated Alfv{\textbackslash}'enic turbulence. Its spectral peak appears to be independent of the resistive scale and comparable to the driving scale of the flow, while the magnetic energy resides in a broad range of scales extending down to the field-reversal scale set by tearing. Emergence of a degree of large-scale magnetic coherence in the saturated state of the turbulent dynamo may be consistent with observations of magnetic-field fluctuations in galaxy clusters and recent laboratory experiments.},

We ﬁnd that the ampliﬁcation histories, saturation values, and morphologies of the magnetic ﬁelds vary considerably depending on the baryonic physics employed, primarily because of differences in the gas density distribution. In particular, adiabatic runs and runs with a sub-grid (effective equation of state) stellar feedback model yield lower saturation values and morphologies that exhibit greater large-scale order compared with runs that adopt explicit stellar feedback and runs with cooling and star formation but no feedback. The discrepancies mostly lie in gas denser than the galactic average, which requires cooling and explicit fragmentation to capture. Independent of the baryonic physics included, the magnetic ﬁeld strength scales with gas density as B ∝ n2/3, suggesting isotropic ﬂux freezing or equipartition between the magnetic and gravitational energies during the ﬁeld ampliﬁcation. We conclude that accurate treatments of cooling, star formation, and stellar feedback are crucial for obtaining the correct magnetic ﬁeld strength and morphology in dense gas, which, in turn, is essential for properly modeling other physical processes that depend on the magnetic ﬁeld, such as cosmic ray feedback.},

	abstract = {Arkenstone is a new model for multiphase, stellar feedback driven galactic winds designed for inclusion in coarse resolution cosmological simulations. In this ﬁrst paper of a series, we describe the features that allow Arkenstone to properly treat high speciﬁc energy wind components and demonstrate them using idealised non-cosmological simulations of a galaxy with a realistic CGM, using the Arepo code. Hot, fast gas phases with low mass loadings are predicted to dominate the energy content of multiphase outﬂows. In order to treat the huge dynamic range of spatial scales involved in cosmological galaxy formation at feasible computational expense, cosmological volume simulations typically employ a Lagrangian code or else use adaptive mesh reﬁnement with a quasi-Lagrangian reﬁnement strategy. However, it is diﬃcult to inject a high speciﬁc energy wind in a Lagrangian scheme without incurring artiﬁcial burstiness. Additionally, the low densities inherent to this type of ﬂow result in poor spatial resolution. Arkenstone addresses these issues with a novel scheme for coupling energy into the ISM/CGM transition region which also provides the necessary level of reﬁnement at the base of the wind. In the absence of our improvements, we show that poor spatial resolution near the sonic point of a hot, fast outﬂow leads to an underestimation of gas acceleration as the wind propagates. We explore the diﬀerent mechanisms by which low and high speciﬁc energy winds can regulate the SFR of galaxies. In future work, we will demonstrate other aspects of the Arkenstone model.},

	abstract = {The origin of the cold phase in the CGM is a highly debated question. We investigate the contribution of satellite galaxies to the cold gas budget in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of a Milky Way-like host galaxy. We perform controlled experiments with three different satellite mass distributions and identify several mechanisms by which satellites can add cold gas to the CGM, including ram pressure stripping and induced cooling in the mixing layer of the stripped cold gas. These two mechanisms contribute a comparable amount of cold gas to the host CGM. We find that the less massive satellites (⩽ 109M⊙) not only lose all of their cold gas in a short period (∼ 0.5-1 Gyr), but their stripped cold clouds also mix with the hot CGM gas and get heated up quickly. However, stellar feedback from these less massive satellites can hugely alter the fate of their stripped gas. Feedback speeds up the destruction of the stripped cold clouds from these satellites by making them more diffuse with more surface area. On the other hand, the more massive satellites (LMC or SMC-like ∼ 1010M⊙) can add cold gas to the total gas budget of the host CGM for several Gyrs.},

	abstract = {We study how jets driven by active galactic nuclei inﬂuence the cooling ﬂow in Perseus-like galaxy cluster cores with idealized, non-relativistic, hydrodynamical simulations performed with the Eulerian code ATHENA using high-resolution Godunov methods with low numerical diffusion. We use novel analysis methods to measure the cooling rate, the heating rate associated with multiple mechanisms, and the power associated with adiabatic compression/expansion. A signiﬁcant reduction of the cooling rate and cooling ﬂow within 20 kpc from the centre can be achieved with kinetic jets. However, at larger scales and away from the jet axis, the system relaxes to a cooling ﬂow conﬁguration. Jet feedback is anisotropic and is mostly distributed along the jet axis, where the cooling rate is reduced and a signiﬁcant fraction of the jet power is converted into kinetic power of heated outﬂowing gas. Away from the jet axis weak shock heating represents the dominant heating source. Turbulent heating is signiﬁcant only near the cluster centre, but it becomes inefﬁcient at ∼50 kpc scales where it only represents a few per cent of the total heating rate. Several details of the simulations depend on the choice made for the hydro solver, a consequence of the difﬁculty of achieving proper numerical convergence for this problem: current physics implementations and resolutions do not properly capture multiphase gas that develops as a consequence of thermal instability. These processes happen at the grid scale and leave numerical solutions sensitive to the properties of the chosen hydro solver.},

The simulations resolve the cooling radii of the majority of supernova remnants (SNRs) and thus self-consistently capture how SNe drive galactic winds. We ﬁnd that SNe launch highly supersonic winds with properties that agree reasonably well with expectations from analytic models. The energy loading (ηE = E˙ wind/E˙ SN) of the winds in our simulations are well converged with spatial resolution while the wind mass loading (ηM = M˙ wind/M˙  ) decreases with resolution at the resolutions we achieve. We present a simple analytic model based on the concept that SNRs with cooling radii greater than the local scaleheight break out of the disc and power the wind. This model successfully explains the dependence (or lack thereof) of ηE (and by extension ηM) on the gas surface density, star formation efﬁciency, disc radius and the clustering of SNe. The winds our simulations are weaker than expected in reality, likely due to the fact that we seed SNe preferentially at density peaks. Clustering SNe in time and space substantially increases the wind power.},

Our analysis includes three disc models with gas surface densities ranging from Milky Way-like galaxies to gas-rich ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), and two different SN driving schemes (random and correlated with local gas density). In order to isolate the physics of SN feedback, we do not include additional feedback processes. We ﬁnd that, in these local box calculations, SN feedback excites relatively low mass-weighted gas turbulent velocity dispersions ≈3–7 km s−1 and low wind mass loading factors η   1 in all the cases we study. The low turbulent velocities and wind mass loading factors predicted by our local box calculations are signiﬁcantly below those suggested by observations of gas-rich and rapidly star-forming galaxies; they are also in tension with global simulations of disc galaxies regulated by stellar feedback. Using a combination of numerical tests and analytic arguments, we argue that local Cartesian boxes cannot predict the properties of galactic winds because they do not capture the correct global geometry and gravitational potential of galaxies. The wind mass loading factors are in fact not well deﬁned in local simulations because they decline signiﬁcantly with increasing box height. More physically realistic calculations (e.g. including a global galactic potential and disc rotation) will likely be needed to fully understand disc turbulence and galactic outﬂows, even for the idealized case of feedback by SNe alone.},

Here, we compute synthetic Faraday rotation maps at z = 0 for a set of disc galaxies from the Auriga high-resolution cosmological simulations, for different observer positions within and outside the galaxy. We ﬁnd that the strength of the Faraday rotation of our simulated galaxies for a hypothetic observer at the solar circle is broadly consistent with the Faraday rotation seen for the Milky Way. The same holds for an observer outside the galaxy and the observed signal of the nearby spiral galaxy M51. However, we also ﬁnd that the structure and angular power spectra of the synthetic all-sky Faraday rotation maps vary strongly with azimuthal position along the solar circle. We argue that this variation is a result of the structure of the magnetic ﬁeld of the galaxy that is dominated by an azimuthal magnetic ﬁeld ordered scales of several kpc, but has radial and vertical magnetic ﬁeld components that are only ordered on scales of 1–2 kpc. Because the magnetic ﬁeld strength decreases exponentially with height above the disc, the Faraday rotation for an observer at the solar circle is dominated by the local environment. This represents a severe obstacle for attempts to reconstruct the global magnetic ﬁeld of the Milky Way from Faraday rotation maps alone without including additional observables.},

Naturally, the resulting magnetic ﬁeld has a complex morphology that includes a strong random component. Using a smoothing of the magnetic ﬁeld on small scales, we were able to separate the mean from the turbulent component and analyze them individually.
Results. We ﬁnd that a mean-ﬁeld dynamo naturally occurs as a result of the dynamical evolution of the galaxy and ampliﬁes the magnetic ﬁeld by an order of magnitude over half a Gyr. Despite the highly dynamical nature of these models, the morphology of the mean component of the ﬁeld is identical to analytical predictions.
Conclusions. This result underlines the importance of the mean-ﬁeld dynamo in galactic evolution. Moreover, by demonstrating the natural growth of the magnetic ﬁeld in a complex galactic environment, it brings us a step closer to understanding the cosmic origin of magnetic ﬁelds.},

	abstract = {Magnetic ﬁelds are known to be dynamically important in the interstellar medium of our own Galaxy, and they are ubiquitously observed in diffuse gas in the haloes of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Yet, magnetic ﬁelds have typically been neglected in studies of the formation of galaxies, leaving their global inﬂuence on galaxy formation largely unclear. Here we extend our magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) implementation in the moving-mesh code AREPO to cosmological problems which include radiative cooling and the formation of stars. In particular, we replace our previously employed divergence cleaning approach with a Powell eight-wave scheme, which turns out to be signiﬁcantly more stable, even in very dynamic environments. We verify the improved accuracy through simulations of the magnetorotational instability in accretion discs, which reproduce the correct linear growth rate of the instability. Using this new MHD code, we simulate the formation of isolated disc galaxies similar to the Milky Way using idealized initial conditions with and without magnetic ﬁelds. We ﬁnd that the magnetic ﬁeld strength is quickly ampliﬁed in the initial central starburst and the differential rotation of the forming disc, eventually reaching a saturation value. At this point, the magnetic ﬁeld pressure in the interstellar medium becomes comparable to the thermal pressure, and a further efﬁcient growth of the magnetic ﬁeld strength is prevented. The additional pressure component leads to a lower star formation rate at late times compared to simulations without magnetic ﬁelds, and induces changes in the spiral arm structures of the gas disc. In addition, we observe highly magnetized fountain-like outﬂows from the disc. These results are robust with numerical resolution and are largely independent of the initial magnetic seed ﬁeld strength assumed in the initial conditions, as the ampliﬁcation process is rapid and self-regulated. Our ﬁndings suggest an important inﬂuence of magnetic ﬁelds on galaxy formation and evolution, cautioning against their neglect in theoretical models of structure formation.},

	abstract = {The magnetic ﬁelds observed in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies appear to be in equipartition with the turbulent, thermal and cosmic ray energy densities, and hence are expected to be dynamically important. However, the origin of these strong magnetic ﬁelds is still unclear, and most previous attempts to simulate galaxy formation from cosmological initial conditions have ignored them altogether. Here, we analyse the magnetic ﬁelds predicted by the simulations of the Auriga Project, a set of 30 high-resolution cosmological zoom simulations of Milky Way like galaxies, carried out with a moving-mesh magnetohydrodynamics code and a detailed galaxy formation physics model. We ﬁnd that the magnetic ﬁelds grow exponentially at early times owing to a small-scale dynamo with an e-folding time of roughly 100 Myr in the centre of haloes until saturation occurs around z = 2–3, when the magnetic energy density reaches about 10 per cent of the turbulent energy density with a typical strength of 10–50 µG. In the galactic centres, the ratio between magnetic and turbulent energies remains nearly constant until z = 0. At larger radii, differential rotation in the discs leads to linear ampliﬁcation that typically saturates around z = 0.5–0. The ﬁnal radial and vertical variations of the magnetic ﬁeld strength can be well described by two joint exponential proﬁles, and are in good agreement with observational constraints. Overall, the magnetic ﬁelds have only little effect on the global evolution of the galaxies as it takes too long to reach equipartition. We also demonstrate that our results are well converged with numerical resolution.},

We use three diﬀerent galaxy formation models, each with and without magnetic ﬁelds, and include additional spatial reﬁnement in the CGM to improve its resolution. The central galaxy’s star formation rate and stellar mass are not strongly aﬀected by the presence of magnetic ﬁelds, but the galaxy is more disc-dominated and its central black hole is more massive when �� {\textgreater} 0. The physical properties of the CGM change signiﬁcantly. With magnetic ﬁelds, the circumgalactic gas ﬂows are slower, the atomic hydrogen-dominated extended discs around the galaxy are more massive and the densities in the inner CGM are therefore higher, the temperatures in the outer CGM are higher, and the pressure in the halo is higher and smoother. The total gas fraction and metal mass fraction in the halo are also higher when magnetic ﬁelds are included, because less gas escapes the halo. Additionally, we ﬁnd that the CGM properties depend on azimuthal angle and that magnetic ﬁelds reduce the scatter in radial velocity, whilst enhancing the scatter in metallicity at ﬁxed azimuthal angle. The metals are thus less well-mixed throughout the halo, resulting in more metal-poor halo gas. These results together show that magnetic ﬁelds in the CGM change the ﬂow of gas in galaxy haloes, making it more diﬃcult for metal-rich outﬂows to mix with the metal-poor CGM and to escape the halo, and therefore should be included in simulations of galaxy formation.},

We investigate the driving mechanisms that set present-day disc sizes/scalelengths, and ﬁnd that they are related to the angular momentum of halo material. We show that the largest discs are produced by quiescent mergers that inspiral into the galaxy and deposit high-angular momentum material into the pre-existing disc, simultaneously increasing the spin of dark matter and gas in the halo. More violent mergers and strong AGN feedback play roles in limiting disc size by destroying pre-existing discs and by suppressing gas accretion on to the outer disc, respectively. The most important factor that leads to compact discs, however, is simply a low angular momentum for the halo. In these cases, AGN feedback plays an important role in limiting central star formation and the formation of a massive bulge.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulations have become a major tool for understanding galaxy formation and evolution. Over the decades the field has made significant progress. It is now possible to simulate the formation of individual galaxies and galaxy populations from well defined initial conditions with realistic abundances and global properties. An essential component of the calculation is to correctly estimate the inflow to and outflow from forming galaxies since observations indicating low formation efficiency and strong circum-glactic presence of gas are persuasive. Energetic 'feedback' from massive stars and accreting super-massive black holes - generally unresolved in cosmological simulations - plays a major role for driving galactic outflows, which have been shown to regulate many aspects of galaxy evolution. A surprisingly large variety of plausible sub-resolution models succeeds in this exercise. They capture the essential characteristics of the problem, i.e. outflows regulating galactic gas flows, but their predictive power is limited. In this review we focus on one major challenge for galaxy formation theory: to understand the underlying physical processes that regulate the structure of the interstellar medium, star formation and the driving of galactic outflows. This requires accurate physical models and numerical simulations, which can precisely describe the multi-phase structure of the interstellar medium on the currently unresolved few hundred parsecs scales of large scale cosmological simulations. Such models ultimately require the full accounting for the dominant cooling and heating processes, the radiation and winds from massive stars and accreting black holes, an accurate treatment of supernova explosions as well as the non-thermal components of the interstellar medium like magnetic fields and cosmic rays.},

The orientations of magnetic fields in interstellar filaments and molecular clouds are traced by polarized thermal dust emission and starlight polarization. The field strengths and directions along the line of sight in dense clouds and cores are measured by Zeeman splitting of emission or absorption lines. The large-scale magnetic fields in the Milky Way have been best probed by Faraday rotation measures of a large number of pulsars and extragalactic radio sources. The coherent Galactic magnetic fields are found to follow the spiral arms and have their direction reversals in arms and interarm regions in the disk. The azimuthal fields in the halo reverse their directions below and above the Galactic plane. The orientations of organized magnetic fields in nearby galaxies have been observed through polarized synchrotron emission. Magnetic fields in the intracluster medium have been indicated by diffuse radio halos, polarized radio relics, and Faraday rotations of embedded radio galaxies and background sources. Sparse evidence for very weak magnetic fields in the cosmic web is the detection of the faint radio bridge between the Coma cluster and A1367. Future observations should aim at the 3D tomography of the large-scale coherent magnetic fields in our Galaxy and nearby galaxies, a better description of intracluster field properties, and firm detections of intergalactic magnetic fields in the cosmic web.},

Among other topics, we consider the enhancement of global magnetic fields in the interarm regions, magnetic spiral arms, and representations as superpositions of azimuthal modes, emphasizing a number of unresolved questions. It is argued that a turbulent hydromagnetic dynamo of some kind and an inverse cascade of magnetic energy gives the most plausible explanation for the regular galactic magnetic fields. Primordial theory is found to be unsatisfactory, and fields of cosmological origin may not even be able to provide a seed field for a dynamo. Although dynamo theory has its own problems, the general form of the dynamo equations appears quite robust. Finally, detailed models of magnetic field generation in galaxies, allowing for factors such as spiral structure, starbursts, galactic winds, and fountains, are discussed and confronted with observations.},

We do this by deﬁning two distinct models for both thermal and cosmic ray (CR) electron distributions. Our results indicate that the maps of RM have structures which are sheared and rendered anisotropically by diﬀerential rotation and that they depend on the choice of thermal electrons model as well as the SN rate. Synchrotron maps are qualitatively similar to the maps of the mean magnetic ﬁeld along the line of sight and structures are only marginally aﬀected by the CR model. Stokes parameters and related quantities, such as the degree of linear polarisation, are highly dependent on both frequency and resolution of the observation.},

The cloud is assumed to be small enough that radiative cooling, thermal conduction, and self-gravity can be ignored. A variety of initial orientations (including parallel, perpendicular, and oblique to the incident shock normal) and strengths for the magnetic field are investigated. During the early stages of the interaction (less than twice the time taken for the transmitted shock to cross the interior of the cloud), the structure and dynamics of the shocked cloud are fairly insensitive to the magnetic field strength and orientation. However, at late times strong fields substantially alter the dynamics of the cloud, suppressing fragmentation and mixing by stabilizing the interface at the cloud surface. Even weak magnetic fields can drastically alter the evolution of the cloud compared to the hydrodynamic case. Weak fields of different geometries result in different distributions and amplifications of the magnetic energy density, which may affect the thermal and nonthermal X-ray emission expected from shocked clouds associated with, for example, supernova remnants.},

We report the results from a comprehensive numerical study that investigates the characteristics, formation, and evolution of filaments arising from magnetohydrodynamic interactions between supersonic winds and dense clouds. Here, we improve on previous simulations by utilizing sharper density contrasts and higher numerical resolutions. By following multiple density tracers, we find that material in the envelopes of the clouds is removed and deposited downstream to form filamentary tails, while the cores of the clouds serve as footpoints and late-stage outer layers of these tails. Aspect ratios ≳12, subsonic velocity dispersions {\textasciitilde}0.1-0.3 of the wind sound speed, and magnetic field amplifications {\textasciitilde}100 are found to be characteristic of these filaments. We also report the effects of different magnetic field strengths and orientations. The magnetic field strength regulates vorticity production: sinuous filamentary towers arise in non-magnetic environments, while strong magnetic fields inhibit small-scale perturbations at boundary layers making tails less turbulent. Magnetic field components aligned with the direction of the flow favour the formation of pressure-confined flux ropes inside the tails, whilst transverse components tend to form current sheets. Softening the equation of state to nearly isothermal leads to suppression of dynamical instabilities and further collimation of the tail. Towards the final stages of the evolution, we find that small cloudlets and distorted filaments survive the break-up of the clouds and become entrained in the winds, reaching velocities {\textasciitilde}0.1 of the wind speed.},

We cover 3D magnetohydrodynamic systems of supersonic winds impacting clouds with turbulent density, velocity, and magnetic fields. We find that log-normal density distributions aid shock propagation through clouds, increasing their velocity dispersion and producing filaments with expanded cross sections and highly-magnetised knots and sub-filaments. In self-consistently turbulent scenarios the ratio of filament to initial cloud magnetic energy densities is {\textasciitilde}1. The effect of Gaussian velocity fields is bound to the turbulence Mach number: Supersonic velocities trigger a rapid cloud expansion; subsonic velocities only have a minor impact. The role of turbulent magnetic fields depends on their tension and is similar to the effect of radiative losses: the stronger the magnetic field or the softer the gas equation of state, the greater the magnetic shielding at wind-filament interfaces and the suppression of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. Overall, we show that including turbulence and magnetic fields is crucial to understanding cold gas entrainment in multi-phase winds. While cloud porosity and supersonic turbulence enhance the acceleration of clouds, magnetic shielding protects them from ablation and causes Rayleigh-Taylor-driven sub-filamentation. Wind-swept clouds in turbulent models reach distances {\textasciitilde}15-20 times their core radius and acquire bulk speeds {\textasciitilde}0.3-0.4 of the wind speed in one cloud-crushing time, which are three times larger than in non-turbulent models. In all simulations the ratio of turbulent magnetic to kinetic energy densities asymptotes at {\textasciitilde}0.1-0.4, and convergence of all relevant dynamical properties requires at least 64 cells per cloud radius.},

	abstract = {We simulate an isolated, magnetised Milky Way-like disc galaxy using a self-consistent model of unresolved star formation and feedback, evolving the system until it reaches statistical steady state. We show that the quasi-steady-state structure is distinctly layered in galactocentric height \$z\$, with an innermost region having comparable gas and magnetic pressures (plasma beta \${\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}sim 1\$), an outermost region having dominant gas pressures (\${\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}gg 1\$), and an intermediate region between \$300\$ pc \${\textbackslash}lesssim {\textbar}z{\textbar} {\textbackslash}lesssim 3\$ kpc that is dynamically dominated by magnetic fields (\${\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}ll 1\$). We find field strengths, gas surface densities, and star formation rates that agree well with those observed both in the Galactic centre and in the Solar neighbourhood. The most significant dynamical effect of magnetic fields on the global properties of the disc is a reduction of the star formation rate by a factor of 1.5-2 with respect to an unmagnetised control simulation. At fixed star formation rate, there is no significant difference in the mass outflow rates or profiles between the magnetised and non-magnetised simulations. Our results for the global structure of the magnetic field have significant implications for models of cosmic ray-driven winds and cosmic-ray propagation in the Galaxy, and can be tested against observations with the forthcoming Square Kilometre Array and other facilities. Finally, we report the discovery of a physical error in the implementation of neutral gas heating and cooling in the popular GIZMO code, which may lead to qualitatively incorrect phase structures if not corrected.},

Processes like CR injection, cooling, adiabatic changes as well as active CR transport through the medium strongly modify the CR momentum distribution and have to be taken into account in hydrodynamical simulations. We present an eﬃcient novel numerical scheme to accurately compute the evolution of the particle distribution function by solving the Fokker-Planck equation with a low number of spectral bins (10 − 20), which is required to include a full spectrum for every computational ﬂuid element. The distribution function is represented by piecewise power laws and is not forced to be continuous, which enables an optimal representation of the spectrum. The Fokker-Planck equation is solved with a two-moment approach evolving the CR number and energy density. The low numerical diﬀusion of the scheme reduces the numerical errors by orders of magnitude in comparison to classical schemes with piecewise constant spectral representations. With this method not only the spectral evolution of CRs can be computed accurately in magnetohydrodynamic simulations but also their dynamical impact as well as CR ionisation. This allows for more accurate models for astrophysical plasmas, like the interstellar medium, and direct comparisons with observations.},

We show that in models that match the γ -ray observations, most CRs escape low-gas-density galaxies (e.g. dwarfs) before signiﬁcant collisional losses, while starburst galaxies are CR proton calorimeters. While adiabatic losses can be signiﬁcant, they occur only after CRs escape galaxies, so they are only of secondary importance for γ -ray emissivities. Models where CRs are ‘trapped’ in the star-forming disc have lower star formation efﬁciency, but these models are ruled out by γ -ray observations. For models with constant κ that match the γ -ray observations, CRs form extended haloes with scale heights of several kpc to several tens of kpc.},

The relative importance of these processes in different galaxy types is still unclear. We model these processes in three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of the formation of isolated galactic discs using the moving-mesh code AREPO, including dynamically coupled CR protons and adopting different CR transport models. We calculate steady-state CR spectra and also account for the emergence of secondary electrons and positrons. This allows us to produce detailed γ -ray maps, luminosities, and spectra of our simulated galaxies at different evolutionary stages. Our simulations with anisotropic CR diffusion and a low CR injection efﬁciency at supernovae (SNe; ζSN = 0.05) can successfully reproduce the observed far-infrared (FIR)–γ -ray relation. Starburst galaxies are close to the calorimetric limit, where CR protons lose most of their energy due to hadronic interactions and hence, their γ -ray emission is dominated by neutral pion decay. However, in low SF galaxies, the increasing diffusive losses soften the CR proton spectra due to energy-dependent diffusion, and likewise steepen the pionic γ -ray spectra. In turn, IC emission hardens the total spectra and can contribute up to ∼40 per cent of the total luminosity in low SF galaxies. Furthermore, in order to match the observed γ -ray spectra of starburst galaxies, we require a weaker energy dependence of the CR diffusion coefﬁcient, D ∝ E0.3, in comparison to Milky Way-like galaxies.},

We systematically study how advection, anisotropic diffusion, and additional Alfv´en-wave cooling affect the galactic disc and the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Global properties such as stellar mass and star formation rate vary little between simulations with and without various CR transport physics, whereas structural properties such as disc sizes, CGM densities, or temperatures can be strongly affected. In our simulations, CRs affect the accretion of gas on to galaxies by modifying the CGM ﬂow structure. This alters the angular momentum distribution that manifests itself as a difference in stellar and gaseous disc size. The strength of this effect depends on the CR transport model: CR advection results in the most compact discs while the Alfv´en-wave model resembles more the AURIGA model. The advection and diffusion models exhibit large (r ∼ 50 kpc) CR pressure-dominated gas haloes causing a smoother and partly cooler CGM. The additional CR pressure smoothes small-scale density peaks and compensates for the missing thermal pressure support at lower CGM temperatures. In contrast, the Alfv´en-wave model is only CR pressure dominated at the disc–halo interface and only in this model the gamma-ray emission from hadronic interactions agrees with observations. In contrast to previous ﬁndings, we conclude that details of CR transport are critical for accurately predicting the impact of CR feedback on galaxy formation.},

To understand the emission, we have used the moving-mesh code AREPO to perform magnetohydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations with self-consistent CR physics. Our galaxy models exhibit a ﬁrst burst of star formation that injects CRs at supernovae. Once CRs have sufﬁciently accumulated in ourMilkyWay–like galaxy, their buoyancy force overcomes the magnetic tension of the toroidal disk ﬁeld. As ﬁeld lines open up, they enable anisotropically diffusing CRs to escape into the halo and to accelerate a bubble-like, CR-dominated outﬂow. However, these bubbles are invisible in our simulated gamma-ray maps of hadronic pion-decay and secondary inverse-Compton emission because of low gas density in the outﬂows. By adopting a phenomenological relation between star formation rate (SFR) and far-infrared emission and assuming that gamma-rays mainly originate from decaying pions, our simulated galaxies can reproduce the observed tight relation between far-infrared and gamma-ray emission, independent of whether we account for anisotropic CR diffusion. This demonstrates that uncertainties in modeling active CR transport processes only play a minor role in predicting gamma-ray emission from galaxies. We ﬁnd that in starbursts, most of the CR energy is “calorimetrically” lost to hadronic interactions. In contrast, the gamma-ray emission deviates from this calorimetric property at low SFRs due to adiabatic losses, which cannot be identiﬁed in traditional one-zone models.},

To improve upon this simpliﬁcation, we present the implementation and ﬁrst application of spectrally resolved CRs which are coupled to the magneto-hydrodynamics in simulations of galaxy formation. The spectral model for the CRs enables more accurate CR cooling and allows for an energy-dependent spatial diﬀusion, for which we introduce a new stable numerical algorithm that proves essential in highly dynamical systems. We perform galaxy formation simulations with this new model and compare the results to a grey CR approach with a simpliﬁed diﬀusive transport and eﬀective cooling that assumes steady-state spectra. We ﬁnd that the galaxies with spectrally resolved CRs diﬀer in morphology, star formation rate, and strength and structure of the outﬂows. The ﬁrst outﬂow front is driven by CRs with average momenta of   200 600 GeV �� 1. The subsequent formation of outﬂows, which reach mass loading factors of order unity, are primarily launched by CRs of progressively smaller average momenta of   8 15 GeV �� 1. The CR spectra in the galactic centre quickly approach a steady state, with small temporal variations. In the outer disc and outﬂow regions, the spectral shape approaches steady state only after   2 Gyr of evolution.

	abstract = {We study the formation of galactic outﬂows from supernova (SN) explosions with the moving-mesh code AREPO in a stratiﬁed column of gas with a surface density similar to the Milky Way disk at the solar circle. We compare different simulation models for SN placement and energy feedback, including cosmic rays (CRs), and ﬁnd that models that place SNe in dense gas and account for CR diffusion are able to drive outﬂows with similar mass loading as obtained from a random placement of SNe with no CRs. Despite this similarity, CR-driven outﬂows differ in several other key properties including their overall clumpiness and velocity. Moreover, the forces driving these outﬂows originate in different sources of pressure, with the CR diffusion model relying on non-thermal pressure gradients to create an outﬂow driven by internal pressure and the random-placement model depending on kinetic pressure gradients to propel a ballistic outﬂow. CRs therefore appear to be non-negligible physics in the formation of outﬂows from the interstellar medium.},

	abstract = {The Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope reveals two large bubbles in the Galaxy, which extend nearly symmetrically ∼50◦ above and below the Galactic center. Using three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic simulations that self-consistently include the dynamical interaction between cosmic rays (CRs) and thermal gas and anisotropic CR diffusion along the magnetic ﬁeld lines, we show that the key characteristics of the observed gamma-ray bubbles and the spatially correlated X-ray features in the ROSAT 1.5 keV map can be successfully reproduced by recent jet activity from the central active galactic nucleus. We ﬁnd that after taking into account the projection of the 3D bubbles onto the sky the physical heights of the bubbles can be much smaller than previously thought, greatly reducing the formation time of the bubbles to about a Myr. This relatively small bubble age is needed to reconcile the simulations with the upper limit of bubble ages estimated from the cooling time of high-energy electrons. No additional physical mechanisms are required to suppress large-scale hydrodynamic instabilities because the evolution time is too short for them to develop. The simulated CR bubbles are edge-brightened, which is consistent with the observed projected ﬂat surface brightness distribution. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the sharp edges of the observed bubbles can be due to anisotropic CR diffusion along magnetic ﬁeld lines that drape around the bubbles during their supersonic expansion, with suppressed perpendicular diffusion across the bubble surface. Possible causes of the slight bends of the Fermi bubbles to the west are also discussed.},

	abstract = {The physics of cosmic rays (CRs) is a promising candidate for explaining the driving of galactic winds and outﬂows. Recent galaxy formation simulations have demonstrated the need for active CR transport either in the form of diffusion or streaming to successfully launch winds in galaxies. However, due to computational limitations, most previous simulations have modeled CR transport isotropically. Here, we discuss high-resolution simulations of isolated disk galaxies in a 1011 Me halo with the moving-mesh code AREPO that include injection of CRs from supernovae, advective transport, CR cooling, and CR transport through isotropic or anisotropic diffusion. We show that either mode of diffusion leads to the formation of strong bipolar outﬂows. However, they develop signiﬁcantly later in the simulation with anisotropic diffusion compared to the simulation with isotropic diffusion. Moreover, we ﬁnd that isotropic diffusion allows most of the CRs to quickly diffuse out of the disk, while in the simulation with anisotropic diffusion, most CRs remain in the disk once the magnetic ﬁeld becomes dominated by its azimuthal component, which occurs after ∼300 Myr. This has important consequences for the gas dynamics in the disk. In particular, we show that isotropic diffusion strongly suppresses the ampliﬁcation of the magnetic ﬁeld in the disk compared to anisotropic or no diffusion models. We therefore conclude that reliable simulations which include CR transport inevitably need to account for anisotropic diffusion.},

We assume that type II supernovae deposit 10\% of their energy into the ISM as cosmic rays (CRs) and neglect the additional deposition of thermal energy or momentum. With a typical Galactic diffusion coefﬁcient for CRs (3 × 1028 cm2 s−1), we demonstrate that this process alone can trigger the local formation of a strong low-density galactic wind maintaining vertically open ﬁeld lines. Driven by the additional pressure gradient of the relativistic ﬂuid, the wind speed can exceed 103 km s−1, much higher than the escape velocity of the galaxy. The global mass loading, i.e., the ratio of the gas mass leaving the galactic disk in a wind to the star formation rate, becomes of order unity once the system has settled into an equilibrium. We conclude that relativistic particles accelerated in supernova remnants alone provide a natural and efﬁcient mechanism to trigger winds similar to observed mass-loaded galactic winds in high-redshift galaxies. These winds also help in explaining the low efﬁciencies for the conversion of gas into stars in galaxies, as well as the early enrichment of the intergalactic medium with metals. This mechanism may be at least of similar importance to the traditionally considered momentum feedback from massive stars and thermal and kinetic feedback from supernova explosions.},

We survey systems from ultrafaint dwarf (M∗ ∼ 104 M , Mhalo ∼ 109 M ) through Milky Way/Local Group (MW/LG) masses, systematically vary uncertain CR parameters (e.g. the diffusion coefﬁcient κ and streaming velocity), and study a broad ensemble of galaxy properties [masses, star formation (SF) histories, mass proﬁles, phase structure, morphologies, etc.]. We conﬁrm previous conclusions that magnetic ﬁelds, conduction, and viscosity on resolved ( 1 pc) scales have only small effects on bulk galaxy properties. CRs have relatively weak effects on all galaxy properties studied in dwarfs (M∗ 1010 M , Mhalo 1011 M ), or at high redshifts (z 1–2), for any physically reasonable parameters. However, at higher masses (Mhalo 1011 M ) and z 1–2, CRs can suppress SF and stellar masses by factors ∼2–4, given reasonable injection efﬁciencies and relatively high effective diffusion coefﬁcients κ 3 × 1029 cm2 s−1. At lower κ, CRs take too long to escape dense star-forming gas and lose their energy to collisional hadronic losses, producing negligible effects on galaxies and violating empirical constraints from spallation and γ -ray emission. At much higher κ CRs escape too efﬁciently to have appreciable effects even in the CGM. But around κ ∼ 3 × 1029 cm2 s−1, CRs escape the galaxy and build up a CR-pressure-dominated halo which maintains approximate virial equilibrium and supports relatively dense, cool (T 106 K) gas that would otherwise rain on to the galaxy. CR ‘heating’ (from collisional and streaming losses) is never dominant.},

	abstract = {The Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) has been preparing the nation’s first exascale system, Frontier, for production and end users. Frontier is based on HPE Cray’s new EX architecture and Slingshot interconnect and features 74 cabinets of optimized 3rd Gen AMD EPYC CPUs for HPC and AI and AMD Instinct 250X accelerators. As a part of this preparation, “real-world” user codes have been selected to help assess the functionality, performance, and usability of the system. This paper describes early experiences using the system in collaboration with the Hamburg Observatory for two selected codes, which have since been adopted in the OLCF Test Harness. Experiences discussed include efforts to resolve performance variability and per-cycle slowdowns. Results are shown for a performance portable astrophysical magnetohydronamics code, AthenaPK, and a mini-application stressing the core functionality of a performance portable block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework, Parthenon-Hydro. These results show good scaling characteristics to the full system. At the largest scale, the Parthenon-Hydro miniapp reaches a total of 1.7 × 1013 zone-cycles/s on 9,216 nodes (73,728 logical GPUs) at ≈ 92\% weak scaling parallel efficiency (starting from a single node using a second-order, finite-volume method).},

GRaM-X supports 3D adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) on GPUs via a new AMR driver for the Einstein Toolkit called CarpetX which in turn leverages AMReX, an AMR library developed for use by the United States DOE's Exascale Computing Project (ECP). We use the Z4c formalism to evolve the equations of GR and the Valencia formulation to evolve the equations of GRMHD. GRaM-X supports both analytic as well as tabulated equations of state. We implement TVD and WENO reconstruction methods as well as the HLLE Riemann solver. We test the accuracy of the code using a range of tests on static spacetime, e.g. 1D MHD shocktubes, the 2D magnetic rotor and a cylindrical explosion, as well as on dynamical spacetimes, i.e. the oscillations of a 3D TOV star. We find excellent agreement with analytic results and results of other codes reported in literature. We also perform scaling tests and find that GRaM-X shows a weak scaling efficiency of \${\textbackslash}sim 40-50{\textbackslash}\%\$ on 2304 nodes (13824 NVIDIA V100 GPUs) with respect to single-node performance on OLCF's supercomputer Summit.},

A 2563 simulation is well within the reach of an Nvidia DGX-V100 server, with the computation being about 10 times faster than if only the CPU is used. We use this code to examine several disk structures all in the SANE state. We ﬁnd that (i) increasing the magnetic ﬁeld in the SANE state does not affect the mass accretion rate; (ii) simultaneously increasing the disk size and the magnetic ﬁeld, while keeping the ratio of energies ﬁxed, leads to the destruction of the jet once the magnetic ﬂux through the horizon decreases below a certain limit (this demonstrates that the existence of a jet is a function of the initial mass distribution, and not of the initial intensity of the magnetic ﬁeld, since the magnetorotational instability dictates the evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld); and (iii) the structure of the jet is a weak function of the adiabatic index of the gas, with relativistic gas tending to have a wider jet.},

Here, we present a GPU-accelerated GRMHD code H-AMR with multifaceted optimizations that, collectively, accelerate computation by 2–5 orders of magnitude for a wide range of applications. First, it introduces a spherical grid with 3D adaptive mesh reﬁnement that operates in each of the three dimensions independently. This allows us to circumvent the Courant condition near the polar singularity, which otherwise cripples high-resolution computational performance. Second, we demonstrate that local adaptive time stepping on a logarithmic spherical-polar grid accelerates computation by a factor of 10 compared to traditional hierarchical time-stepping approaches. Jointly, these unique features lead to an effective speed of ∼109 zone cycles per second per node on 5400 NVIDIA V100 GPUs (i.e., 900 nodes of the OLCF Summit supercomputer). We illustrate H-AMRʼs computational performance by presenting the ﬁrst GRMHD simulation of a tilted thin accretion disk threaded by a toroidal magnetic ﬁeld around a rapidly spinning black hole. With an effective resolution of 13,440 × 4608 × 8092 cells and a total of 22 billion cells and ∼0.65 × 108 time steps, it is among the largest astrophysical simulations ever performed. We ﬁnd that frame dragging by the black hole tears up the disk into two independently precessing subdisks. The innermost subdisk rotation axis intermittently aligns with the black hole spin, demonstrating for the ﬁrst time that such long-sought alignment is possible in the absence of large-scale poloidal magnetic ﬁelds.},

GAMER-2 is fully bitwise reproducible. For the performance optimization, it adopts hybrid OpenMP/MPI/GPU parallelization and utilizes overlapping CPU computation, GPU computation, and CPU–GPU communication. Load balancing is achieved using a Hilbert space-ﬁlling curve on a level-by-level basis without the need to duplicate the entire AMR hierarchy on each MPI process. To provide convincing demonstrations of the accuracy and performance of GAMER-2, we directly compare with ENZO on isolated disc galaxy simulations and with FLASH on galaxy cluster merger simulations. We show that the physical results obtained by different codes are in very good agreement, and GAMER-2 outperforms ENZO and FLASH by nearly one and two orders of magnitude, respectively, on the Blue Waters supercomputers using 1–256 nodes. More importantly, GAMER-2 exhibits similar or even better parallel scalability compared to the other two codes. We also demonstrate good weak and strong scaling using up to 4096 GPUs and 65 536 CPU cores, and achieve a uniform resolution as high as 10 2403 cells. Furthermore, GAMER-2 can be adopted as an AMR + GPUs framework and has been extensively used for the wave dark matter simulations.

	abstract = {A magnetic ﬁeld dynamo in the inner regions of the accretion disk surrounding the supermassive black holes in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) may be the mechanism for the generation of magnetic ﬁelds in galaxies and in extragalactic space. We argue that the two coherent motions produced by 1) the Keplerian motion and 2) star-disk collisions, numerous in the inner region of AGN accretion disks, are both basic to the formation of a robust, coherent dynamo and consequently the generation of large scale magnetic ﬁelds. In addition we ﬁnd that the predicted rate, 10 to 100 per year at ∼ 1000rg, rg the gravitational radius, and the consequences of star-disk collisions are qualitatively, at least, not inconsistent with observations of broad emission and absorption lines. They are frequent enough to account for an integrated dynamo gain, e109 at 100rg, many orders of magnitude greater than required to amplify any seed ﬁeld no matter how small. The existence of extra-galactic, coherent, large scale magnetic ﬁelds whose energies greatly exceed all but massive black hole energies is recognized. In paper II (Pariev, Colgate \& Finn 2006) we argue that in order to produce a dynamo that can access the free energy of black hole formation and produce all the magnetic ﬂux in a coherent fashion the existence of these two coherent motions in a conducting ﬂuid is required. The diﬀerential winding of Keplerian motion is obvious, but the disk structure depends upon the model of ”α”, the transport coeﬃcient of angular momentum chosen. The counter rotation of driven plumes in a rotating frame is less well known, but fortunately the magnetic eﬀect is independent of the disk model. Both motions are discussed in this paper, paper I. The description of the two motions are preliminary to two theoretical derivations and one numerical simulation of the αω dynamo in paper II.},

	abstract = {It is shown that a dynamo can operate in an Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) accretion disk due to the Keplerian shear and due to the helical motions of expanding and twisting plumes of plasma heated by many star passages through the disk. Each plume rotates a fraction of the toroidal ﬂux into poloidal ﬂux, always in the same direction, through a ﬁnite angle, and proportional to its diameter. The predicted growth rate of poloidal magnetic ﬂux, based upon two analytic approaches and numerical simulations, leads to a rapid exponentiation of a seed ﬁeld, ∼ 0.1 to ∼ 0.01 per Keplerian period of the inner part of the disk. The initial value of the seed ﬁeld may therefore be arbitrarily small yet reach, through dynamo gain, saturation very early in the disk history. Because of tidal disruption of stars close to the black hole, the maximum growth rate occurs at a radius of about 100 gravitational radii from the central object. The generated mean magnetic ﬁeld, a quadrupole ﬁeld, has predominantly even parity so that the radial component does not reverse sign across the midplane. The linear growth is predicted to be the same by each of the following three theoretical analyses: the ﬂux conversion model, the mean ﬁeld approach, and numerical modeling. The common feature is the conducting ﬂuid ﬂow, considered in companion Paper I (Pariev \& Colgate 2006) where two coherent large scale ﬂows occur naturally: the diﬀerential winding of Keplerian motion and diﬀerential rotation of expanding plumes.},

    abstract = { Spiral galaxies, including the Milky Way, have large-scale magnetic fields with significant energy densities. The dominant theory attributes these magnetic fields to a large-scale dynamo. We review the current status of dynamo theory and discuss various numerical simulations designed either to explain particular aspects of the problem or to reproduce galactic magnetic fields globally. Our main conclusions can be summarized as follows: ▪Idealized direct numerical simulations produce mean magnetic fields, whose saturation energy density tends to decline with increasing magnetic Reynolds number. This is still an unsolved problem. ▪Large-scale galactic magnetic fields of microgauss strengths can probably be explained only if helical magnetic fields of small or moderate length scales can be rapidly ejected or destroyed. ▪Small-scale dynamos are important throughout a galaxy's life and probably provide strong seed fields at early stages. ▪The circumgalactic medium (CGM) may play an important role in driving dynamo action at small and large length scales. These interactions between the galactic disk and the CGM may provide important insights into our understanding of galactic dynamos. We expect future research in galactic dynamos to focus on the cosmological history of galaxies and the interaction with the CGM as means of replacing the idealized boundary conditions used in earlier work. }

More than 3,000 pulsars are currently known, including especially more than 200 of them studied at gamma-ray frequencies. By putting recent insights into the pulsar magnetosphere in a historical context and by comparing them to key observational features at radio and high-energy frequencies, we show the following: ▪ Magnetospheric structure of young energetic pulsars is now understood. Limitations still exist for old nonrecycled and millisecond pulsars. ▪ The observed high-energy radiation is likely produced in the magnetospheric current sheet beyond the light cylinder. ▪ There are at least two different radio emission mechanisms. One operates in the inner magnetosphere, whereas the other one works near the light cylinder and is specific to pulsars with the high magnetic field strength in that region. ▪ Radio emission from the inner magnetosphere is intrinsically connected to the process of pair production, and its observed properties contain the imprint of both the geometry and propagation effects through the magnetospheric plasma. We discuss the limitations of our understanding and identify a range of observed phenomena and physical processes that still await explanation in thefuture. This includes connecting the magnetospheric processes to spin-down properties to explain braking and possible evolution of spin orientation, building a first-principles model of radio emission and quantitative connections with observations. }

In order to determine the magnetic field in the chromosphere, transition region, and corona, we need to measure and interpret the polarization signals that the scattering of anisotropic radiation and the Hanle and Zeeman effects introduce in the emitted spectral line radiation. A number of recent advances have activated the development of this research field. ▪ The quantum theory of the generation and transfer of polarized radiation allows us to explain the polarization signals observed in chromospheric and coronal lines and to make successful predictions in unexplored spectral regions. ▪ The development of diagnostic techniques for the solar upper atmosphere has served to improve our empirical knowledge of the magnetic field in a variety of plasma structures, as well as to pave the way for their application to the unprecedented data that the new generation of solar telescopes are expected to provide. However, further improvements are required. ▪ The CLASP suborbital experiments have opened a new diagnostic window, namely ultraviolet (UV) spectropolarimetry as a tool for probing the magnetism and geometry of the upper chromosphere and transition region. A space telescope equipped with a UV spectropolarimeter would lead to major advances in our empirical understanding of solar magnetism. }

There is striking progress in both observational and theoretical research of MHD wave processes in the corona, with the main recent achievements summarized as follows: ▪ Both periods and wavelengths of the principal MHD modes of coronal plasma structures, such as kink, slow and sausage modes, are confidently resolved. ▪ Scalings of various parameters of detected waves and waveguiding plasma structures allow for the validation of theoretical models. In particular, kink oscillation period scales linearly with the length of the oscillating coronal loop, clearly indicating that they are eigenmodes of the loop. Damping of decaying kink and standing slow oscillations depends on the oscillation amplitudes, demonstrating the importance of nonlinear damping. ▪ The dominant excitation mechanism for decaying kink oscillations is associated with magnetized plasma eruptions. Propagating slow waves are caused by the leakage of chromospheric oscillations. Fast wave trains could be formed by waveguide dispersion. ▪ The knowledge gained in the study of coronal MHD waves provides ground for seismological probing of coronal plasma parameters, such as the Alfvén speed, the magnetic field and its topology, stratification, temperature, fine structuring, polytropic index, and transport coefficients. }

However, there has been less agreement about how jets form in accretion flows, their possible relationship to black hole spin, and how they interact with the surrounding medium. There have also been theoretical concerns about instabilities in standard accretion disk models and lingering discrepancies with observational constraints. Despite seemingly successful applications to X-ray binaries, the standard accretion disk model faces a growing list of observational constraints that challenge its application to AGNs. Theoretical exploration of these questions has become increasingly reliant on numerical simulations owing to the dynamic nature of these flows and the complex interplay between hydrodynamics, magnetic fields, radiation transfer, and curved spacetime. We conclude the following: ▪ The advent of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations has greatly improved our understanding of jet production and its dependence on black hole spin. ▪ Simulation results show both disks and jets are sensitive to the magnetic flux threading the accretion flow as well as possible misalignment between the angular momentum of the accretion flow and the black hole spin. ▪ Radiation MHD simulations are providing new insights into the stability of luminous accretion flows and highlighting the potential importance of radiation viscosity, UV opacity from atoms, and spiral density waves in AGNs. }

The population of detected magnetars has grown to about 30 objects and shows unambiguous phenomenological connection with highly magnetized radio pulsars.

These active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can form jets that are observed on scales from astronomical units to megaparsecs and from meter wavelengths to TeV energies. High-resolution radio imaging and multiwavelength/messenger campaigns are elucidating the conditions under which this happens. Evidence is presented that: ▪ Relativistic AGN jets are formed when the black hole spins and the the accretion disk is strongly magnetized, perhaps on account of gas accreting at high latitude beyond the black hole sphere of influence. ▪ AGN jets are collimated close to the black hole by magnetic stress associated with a disk wind. ▪ Higher-power jets can emerge from their galactic nuclei in a relativistic, supersonic, and proton-dominated state, and they terminate in strong, hot spot shocks; lower-power jets are degraded to buoyant plumes and bubbles. ▪ Jets may accelerate protons to EeV energies, which contribute to the cosmic ray spectrum and may initiate pair cascades that can efficiently radiate synchrotron γ-rays. ▪ Jets were far more common when the Universe was a few billion years old and black holes and massive galaxies were growing rapidly. ▪ Jets can have a major influence on their environments, stimulating and limiting the growth of galaxies.The observational prospects for securing our understanding of AGN jets are bright. }

To understand how such magnetic ﬁelds would affect the global morphological and dynamical properties of galaxies, we use a suite of high-resolution constrained transport magnetohydrodynamic cosmological zoom simulations where we vary the initial magnetic ﬁeld strength and conﬁguration along with the prescription for stellar feedback. We ﬁnd that strong primordial magnetic ﬁelds delay the onset of star formation and drain the rotational support of the galaxy, diminishing the radial size of the galactic disc and driving a higher amount of gas towards the centre. This is also reﬂected in mock UVJ observations by an increase in the light proﬁle concentration of the galaxy. We explore the possible mechanisms behind such a reduction in angular momentum, focusing on magnetic braking. Finally, noticing that the effects of primordial magnetic ﬁelds are ampliﬁed in the presence of stellar feedback, we brieﬂy discuss whether the changes we measure would also be expected for galactic magnetic ﬁelds of non-primordial origin.},

To better understand their evolution in the cosmological context of hierarchical galaxy growth, we probe the ampliﬁcation process undergone by the cosmic magnetic ﬁeld within a spiral galaxy to unprecedented accuracy by means of a suite of constrained transport magnetohydrodynamical adaptive mesh reﬁnement cosmological zoom simulations with different stellar feedback prescriptions. A galactic turbulent dynamo is found to be naturally excited in this cosmological environment, being responsible for most of the ampliﬁcation of the magnetic energy. Indeed, we ﬁnd that the magnetic energy spectra of simulated galaxies display telltale inverse cascades. Overall, the ampliﬁcation process can be divided in three main phases, which are related to different physical mechanisms driving galaxy evolution: an initial collapse phase, an accretion-driven phase, and a feedback-driven phase. Whilst different feedback models affect the magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation differently, all tested models prove to be sub-dominant at early epochs, before the feedback-driven phase is reached. Thus, the three-phase evolution paradigm is found to be quite robust vis-`a-vis feedback prescriptions.},

	abstract = {We assess the validity of a single step Godunov scheme for the solution of the magnetohydrodynamics equations in more than one dimension. The scheme is second-order accurate and the temporal discretization is based on the dimensionally unsplit Corner Transport Upwind (CTU) method of Colella. The proposed scheme employs a cell-centered representation of the primary ﬂuid variables (including magnetic ﬁeld) and conserves mass, momentum, magnetic induction and energy. A variant of the scheme, which breaks momentum and energy conservation, is also considered. Divergence errors are transported out of the domain and damped using the mixed hyperbolic/parabolic divergence cleaning technique by Dedner et al. (2002) [11]. The strength and accuracy of the scheme are veriﬁed by a direct comparison with the eight-wave formulation (also employing a cell-centered representation) and with the popular constrained transport method, where magnetic ﬁeld components retain a staggered collocation inside the computational cell. Results obtained from two- and three-dimensional test problems indicate that the newly proposed scheme is robust, accurate and competitive with recent implementations of the constrained transport method while being considerably easier to implement in existing hydro codes.},

abstract="An approximate Riemann solver is developed for the governing equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The Riemann solver has an eight-wave structure, where seven of the waves are those used in previous work on upwind schemes for MHD, and the eighth wave is related to the divergence of the magnetic field. The structure of the eighth wave is not immediately obvious from the governing equations as they are usually written, but arises from a modification of the equations that is presented in this paper. The addition of the eighth wave allows multi-dimensional MHD problems to be solved without the use of staggered grids or a projection scheme, one or the other of which was necessary in previous work on upwind schemes for MHD. A test problem made up of a shock tube with rotated initial conditions is solved to show that the two-dimensional code yields answers consistent with the one-dimensional methods developed previously.",

abstract = {We present a second-order Godunov algorithm for multidimensional, ideal MHD. Our algorithm is based on the unsplit formulation of Colella (J. Comput. Phys. 87, 1990), with all of the primary dependent variables centered at the same location. To properly represent the divergence-free condition of the magnetic fields, we apply a discrete projection to the intermediate values of the field at cell faces, and apply a filter to the primary dependent variables at the end of each time step. We test the method against a suite of linear and nonlinear tests to ascertain accuracy and stability of the scheme under a variety of conditions. The test suite includes rotated planar linear waves, MHD shock tube problems, low-beta flux tubes, and a magnetized rotor problem. For all of these cases, we observe that the algorithm is second-order accurate for smooth solutions, converges to the correct weak solution for problems involving shocks, and exhibits no evidence of instability or loss of accuracy due to the possible presence of non-solenoidal fields.}
