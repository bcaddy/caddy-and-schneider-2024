	abstract = {We describe a numerical algorithm based on Godunov methods for integrating the equations of compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in multidimensions. It combines a simple, dimensionally-unsplit integration method with the constrained transport (CT) discretization of the induction equation to enforce the divergence-free constraint. We present the results of a series of fully three-dimensional tests which indicate the method is second-order accurate for smooth solutions in all MHD wave families, and captures shocks, contact and rotational discontinuities well. However, it is also more diffusive than other more complex unsplit integrators combined with CT. Thus, the primary advantage of the method is its simplicity. It does not require a characteristic tracing step to construct interface values for the Riemann solver, it is straightforward to extend with additional physics, and it is suitable for use with nested and adaptive meshes. The method is implemented as one of two dimensionally unsplit MHD integrators in the Athena code, which is freely available for download from the web. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A new code for astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is described. The code has been designed to be easily extensible for use with static and adaptive mesh refinement. It combines higher order Godunov methods with the constrained transport (CT) technique to enforce the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field. Discretization is based on cell-centered volume averages for mass, momentum, and energy, and face-centered area averages for the magnetic field. Novel features of the algorithm include (1) a consistent framework for computing the time-and edge-averaged electric fields used by CT to evolve the magnetic field from the time-and area-averaged Godunov fluxes, (2) the extension to MHD of spatial reconstruction schemes that involve a dimensionally split time advance, and (3) the extension to MHD of two different dimensionally unsplit integration methods. Implementation of the algorithm in both C and FORTRAN95 is detailed, including strategies for parallelization using domain decomposition. Results from a test suite which includes problems in one-, two-, and three-dimensions for both hydrodynamics and MHD are given, not only to demonstrate the fidelity of the algorithms, but also to enable comparisons to other methods.

We adopt the most compact form of CT, which requires the field be represented by area-averages at cell faces. We demonstrate that the fluxes of the area-averaged field used by CT can be made consistent with the fluxes of the volume-averaged field returned by a Riemann solver if they obey certain simple relationships. We use these relationships to derive new algorithms for constructing the CT fluxes at grid cell corners which reduce exactly to the equivalent one-dimensional solver for plane-parallel, grid-aligned flow. We show that the PPM reconstruction algorithm must include multidimensional terms for MHD, and we describe a number of important extensions that must be made to CTU in order for it to be used for MHD with CT.

It is intended primarily for applications in astrophysical ﬂuid dynamics, but its ﬂexible and modular design enables its use for a wide variety of physics. The framework works with both uniform and nonuniform grids in Cartesian and curvilinear coordinate systems. It adopts a dynamic execution model based on a simple design called a “task list” that improves parallel performance by overlapping communication and computation, simpliﬁes the inclusion of a diverse range of physics, and even enables multiphysics models involving different physics in different regions of the calculation. We describe physics modules implemented in this framework for both nonrelativistic and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). These modules adopt mature and robust algorithms originally developed for the Athena MHD code and incorporate new extensions: support for curvilinear coordinates, higherorder time integrators, more realistic physics such as a general equation of state, and diffusion terms that can be integrated with super-time-stepping algorithms. The modules show excellent performance and scaling, with well over 80\% parallel efﬁciency on over half a million threads. The source code has been made publicly available.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jcp.2005.02.017},
	abstract = {A new multi-state Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL) approximate Riemann solver for the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations is developed based on the assumption that the normal velocity is constant over the Riemann fan. This assumption is same as that used in the HLLC ("C" denotes Contact) approximate Riemann solver for the Euler equations. From the assumption, it is naturally derived that the Riemann fan should consist of four intermediate states for Bx ≠ 0, whereas the number of the intermediate states is reduced to two when Bx = 0. Since the intermediate states satisfied with all jump conditions in this approximate Riemann system are analytically obtained, the multi-state HLL Riemann solver can be constructed straightforwardly. It is shown that this solver can exactly resolve isolated discontinuities formed in the MHD system, and hence named as HLLD Riemann solver. (Here, "D" stands for Discontinuities.) It is also analytically proved that the HLLD Riemann solver is positively conservative like the HLLC Riemann solver. Indeed, the HLLD Riemann solver corresponds to the HLLC Riemann solver when the magnetic field vanishes. Numerical tests demonstrate that the HLLD Riemann solver is more robust and efficient than the linearized Riemann solver, and its resolution is equally good. It indicates that the HLLD solver must be useful in practical applications for the ideal MHD equations. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Recently, upwind differencing schemes have become very popular for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations, especially when discontinuities exist in the solutions. Among many upwind schemes successfully applied to rhe problems in gas dynamics, Roe's method stands out for its relative simplicity and clarity of the underlying physical model. In this paper, an upwind differencing scheme of Roe-type for the MHD equations is constructed. In each computational cell, the problem is first linearized around some averaged state which preserves the flux differences. Then the solution is advanced in time by computing the wave contributions to the flux at the cell interfaces. One crucial task of the linearization procedure is the construction of a Roe matrix. For the special case {\textgreater}J = 2, a Roe matrix in the form of a mean value Jacobian is found, and for the general case, a simple averaging procedure is introduced. All other necessary ingredients of the construction, which include eigenvalues, and a complete set of right eigenvectors of the Roe matrix and decomposition coefficients are presented. As a numerical example, we chose a coplanar MHD Riemann problem. The problem is solved by the newly constructed second-order upwind scheme as well as by the Lax Friedrichs, the Lax-Wendroff, and the flux-corrected transport schemes. The results demonstrate several advantages of the upwind scheme. In this paper, we also show that the MHD equations are nonconvex. This is a contrast to the general belief that the fast and slow waves are like sound waves in the Euler equations. As a consequence, the wave structure becomes more complicated; for example, compound waves consisting of a shock and attached to it a rarefaction wave of the same family can exist in MHD.},

The algorithm is based on the full 12-solve spatially unsplit corner-transport-upwind (CTU) scheme. The fluid quantities are cell-centered and are updated using the piecewise-parabolic method (PPM), while the magnetic field variables are face-centered and are evolved through application of the Stokes theorem on cell edges via a constrained-transport (CT) method. The so-called multidimensional MHD source terms required in the predictor step for high-order accuracy are applied in a simplified form which reduces their complexity in three dimensions without loss of accuracy or robustness. The algorithm is implemented on an AMR framework which requires specific synchronization steps across refinement levels. These include face-centered restriction and prolongation operations and a reflux-curl operation, which maintains a solenoidal magnetic field across refinement boundaries. The code is tested against a large suite of test problems, including convergence tests in smooth flows, shock-tube tests, classical two- and three-dimensional MHD tests, a three-dimensional shock-cloud interaction problem, and the formation of a cluster of galaxies in a fully cosmological context.

Cholla models the Euler equations on a static mesh using state-of-the-art techniques, including the unsplit Corner Transport Upwind algorithm, a variety of exact and approximate Riemann solvers, and multiple spatial reconstruction techniques including the piecewise parabolic method (PPM). Using GPUs, Cholla evolves the fluid properties of thousands of cells simultaneously and can update over 10 million cells per GPU-second while using an exact Riemann solver and PPM reconstruction. Owing to the massively parallel architecture of GPUs and the design of the Cholla code, astrophysical simulations with physically interesting grid resolutions (2563) can easily be computed on a single device. We use the Message Passing Interface library to extend calculations onto multiple devices and demonstrate nearly ideal scaling beyond 64 GPUs. A suite of test problems highlights the physical accuracy of our modeling and provides a useful comparison to other codes. We then use Cholla to simulate the interaction of a shock wave with a gas cloud in the interstellar medium, showing that the evolution of the cloud is highly dependent on its density structure. We reconcile the computed mixing time of a turbulent cloud with a realistic density distribution destroyed by a strong shock with the existing analytic theory for spherical cloud destruction by describing the system in terms of its median gas density.},

	abstract = {In this paper I review three key topics in CFD that have kept researchers busy for half a century. First, the concept of upwind diﬀerencing, evident for 1-D linear advection. Second, its implementation for nonlinear systems in the form of highresolution schemes, now regarded as classical. Third, its genuinely multidimensional implementation in the form of residual-distribution schemes, the most recent addition. This lecture focuses on historical developments; it is not intended as a technical review of methods, hence the lack of formulas and absence of ﬁgures.},

	abstract = {The nonlinear evolution of monochromatic large-amplitude circularly polarized Alfv´en waves subject to the decay instability is studied via numerical simulations in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. The asymptotic value of the cross helicity depends strongly on the plasma beta: in the low beta case multiple decays are observed, with about half of the energy being transferred to waves propagating in the opposite direction at lower wave numbers, for each saturation step. Correspondingly, the other half of the total transverse energy (kinetic and magnetic) goes into energy carried by the daughter compressive waves and to the associated shock heating. In higher beta conditions we ﬁnd instead that the cross helicity decreases monotonically with time towards zero, implying an asymptotic balance between inward and outward Alfv´enic modes, a feature similar to the observed decrease with distance in the solar wind. Although the instability mainly takes place along the propagation direction, in the two and three-dimensional case a turbulent cascade occurs also transverse to the ﬁeld. The asymptotic state of density ﬂuctuations appears to be rather isotropic, whereas a slight preferential cascade in the transverse direction is seen in magnetic ﬁeld spectra. Finally, parametric decay is shown to occur also in a non-periodic domain with open boundaries, when the mother wave is continuously injected from one side. In two and three dimensions a strong transverse ﬁlamentation is found at long times, reminiscent of density ray-like features observed in the extended solar corona and pressure-balanced structures found in solar wind data.},

	abstract = {We present a fourth-order accurate ﬁnite volume method for the solution of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The numerical method combines high-order quadrature rules in the solution of semi-discrete formulations of hyperbolic conservation laws with the upwind constrained transport (UCT) framework to ensure that the divergence-free constraint of the magnetic ﬁeld is satisﬁed. A novel implementation of UCT that uses the piecewise parabolic method (PPM) for the reconstruction of magnetic ﬁelds at cell corners in 2D is introduced. The resulting scheme can be expressed as the extension of the second-order accurate constrained transport (CT) Godunov-type scheme that is currently used in the Athena astrophysics code. After validating the base algorithm on a series of hydrodynamics test problems, we present the results of multidimensional MHD test problems which demonstrate formal fourth-order convergence for smooth problems, robustness for discontinuous problems, and improved accuracy relative to the second-order scheme.},

abstract="A general tool for solving MHD and hydrodynamical problems typical of astrophysical applications is designed and implemented. The code allows the user to solve a hyperbolic system of partial differential equations with a variety of modern high resolution numerical schemes on 1, 2 or 3D non-uniform Cartesian grids with slab or axial symmetry. The equations may contain fluxes and source terms. The boundary conditions can be chosen from a number of implemented types, --- fixed, periodic, reflective or `free' --- but the code is structured in a manner that allows the user to write his/her own subroutines for a new type of boundary condition, or even to implement a new set of equations. The choice of algorithms allows the user to find the optimal one for the application at hand and/or to compare results of different schemes thus gaining insight into the numerical effects. An emphasis is put on independence of computer platforms. Efficiency of the code is also a high priority, the options available for the user should not compromise the performance.",
