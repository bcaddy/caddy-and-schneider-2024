	abstract = {We describe a numerical algorithm based on Godunov methods for integrating the equations of compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in multidimensions. It combines a simple, dimensionally-unsplit integration method with the constrained transport (CT) discretization of the induction equation to enforce the divergence-free constraint. We present the results of a series of fully three-dimensional tests which indicate the method is second-order accurate for smooth solutions in all MHD wave families, and captures shocks, contact and rotational discontinuities well. However, it is also more diffusive than other more complex unsplit integrators combined with CT. Thus, the primary advantage of the method is its simplicity. It does not require a characteristic tracing step to construct interface values for the Riemann solver, it is straightforward to extend with additional physics, and it is suitable for use with nested and adaptive meshes. The method is implemented as one of two dimensionally unsplit MHD integrators in the Athena code, which is freely available for download from the web. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A new code for astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is described. The code has been designed to be easily extensible for use with static and adaptive mesh refinement. It combines higher order Godunov methods with the constrained transport (CT) technique to enforce the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field. Discretization is based on cell-centered volume averages for mass, momentum, and energy, and face-centered area averages for the magnetic field. Novel features of the algorithm include (1) a consistent framework for computing the time-and edge-averaged electric fields used by CT to evolve the magnetic field from the time-and area-averaged Godunov fluxes, (2) the extension to MHD of spatial reconstruction schemes that involve a dimensionally split time advance, and (3) the extension to MHD of two different dimensionally unsplit integration methods. Implementation of the algorithm in both C and FORTRAN95 is detailed, including strategies for parallelization using domain decomposition. Results from a test suite which includes problems in one-, two-, and three-dimensions for both hydrodynamics and MHD are given, not only to demonstrate the fidelity of the algorithms, but also to enable comparisons to other methods.

We adopt the most compact form of CT, which requires the field be represented by area-averages at cell faces. We demonstrate that the fluxes of the area-averaged field used by CT can be made consistent with the fluxes of the volume-averaged field returned by a Riemann solver if they obey certain simple relationships. We use these relationships to derive new algorithms for constructing the CT fluxes at grid cell corners which reduce exactly to the equivalent one-dimensional solver for plane-parallel, grid-aligned flow. We show that the PPM reconstruction algorithm must include multidimensional terms for MHD, and we describe a number of important extensions that must be made to CTU in order for it to be used for MHD with CT.

It is intended primarily for applications in astrophysical ﬂuid dynamics, but its ﬂexible and modular design enables its use for a wide variety of physics. The framework works with both uniform and nonuniform grids in Cartesian and curvilinear coordinate systems. It adopts a dynamic execution model based on a simple design called a “task list” that improves parallel performance by overlapping communication and computation, simpliﬁes the inclusion of a diverse range of physics, and even enables multiphysics models involving different physics in different regions of the calculation. We describe physics modules implemented in this framework for both nonrelativistic and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). These modules adopt mature and robust algorithms originally developed for the Athena MHD code and incorporate new extensions: support for curvilinear coordinates, higherorder time integrators, more realistic physics such as a general equation of state, and diffusion terms that can be integrated with super-time-stepping algorithms. The modules show excellent performance and scaling, with well over 80\% parallel efﬁciency on over half a million threads. The source code has been made publicly available.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jcp.2005.02.017},
	abstract = {A new multi-state Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL) approximate Riemann solver for the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations is developed based on the assumption that the normal velocity is constant over the Riemann fan. This assumption is same as that used in the HLLC ("C" denotes Contact) approximate Riemann solver for the Euler equations. From the assumption, it is naturally derived that the Riemann fan should consist of four intermediate states for Bx ≠ 0, whereas the number of the intermediate states is reduced to two when Bx = 0. Since the intermediate states satisfied with all jump conditions in this approximate Riemann system are analytically obtained, the multi-state HLL Riemann solver can be constructed straightforwardly. It is shown that this solver can exactly resolve isolated discontinuities formed in the MHD system, and hence named as HLLD Riemann solver. (Here, "D" stands for Discontinuities.) It is also analytically proved that the HLLD Riemann solver is positively conservative like the HLLC Riemann solver. Indeed, the HLLD Riemann solver corresponds to the HLLC Riemann solver when the magnetic field vanishes. Numerical tests demonstrate that the HLLD Riemann solver is more robust and efficient than the linearized Riemann solver, and its resolution is equally good. It indicates that the HLLD solver must be useful in practical applications for the ideal MHD equations. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Recently, upwind differencing schemes have become very popular for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations, especially when discontinuities exist in the solutions. Among many upwind schemes successfully applied to rhe problems in gas dynamics, Roe's method stands out for its relative simplicity and clarity of the underlying physical model. In this paper, an upwind differencing scheme of Roe-type for the MHD equations is constructed. In each computational cell, the problem is first linearized around some averaged state which preserves the flux differences. Then the solution is advanced in time by computing the wave contributions to the flux at the cell interfaces. One crucial task of the linearization procedure is the construction of a Roe matrix. For the special case {\textgreater}J = 2, a Roe matrix in the form of a mean value Jacobian is found, and for the general case, a simple averaging procedure is introduced. All other necessary ingredients of the construction, which include eigenvalues, and a complete set of right eigenvectors of the Roe matrix and decomposition coefficients are presented. As a numerical example, we chose a coplanar MHD Riemann problem. The problem is solved by the newly constructed second-order upwind scheme as well as by the Lax Friedrichs, the Lax-Wendroff, and the flux-corrected transport schemes. The results demonstrate several advantages of the upwind scheme. In this paper, we also show that the MHD equations are nonconvex. This is a contrast to the general belief that the fast and slow waves are like sound waves in the Euler equations. As a consequence, the wave structure becomes more complicated; for example, compound waves consisting of a shock and attached to it a rarefaction wave of the same family can exist in MHD.},

The algorithm is based on the full 12-solve spatially unsplit corner-transport-upwind (CTU) scheme. The fluid quantities are cell-centered and are updated using the piecewise-parabolic method (PPM), while the magnetic field variables are face-centered and are evolved through application of the Stokes theorem on cell edges via a constrained-transport (CT) method. The so-called multidimensional MHD source terms required in the predictor step for high-order accuracy are applied in a simplified form which reduces their complexity in three dimensions without loss of accuracy or robustness. The algorithm is implemented on an AMR framework which requires specific synchronization steps across refinement levels. These include face-centered restriction and prolongation operations and a reflux-curl operation, which maintains a solenoidal magnetic field across refinement boundaries. The code is tested against a large suite of test problems, including convergence tests in smooth flows, shock-tube tests, classical two- and three-dimensional MHD tests, a three-dimensional shock-cloud interaction problem, and the formation of a cluster of galaxies in a fully cosmological context.

Cholla models the Euler equations on a static mesh using state-of-the-art techniques, including the unsplit Corner Transport Upwind algorithm, a variety of exact and approximate Riemann solvers, and multiple spatial reconstruction techniques including the piecewise parabolic method (PPM). Using GPUs, Cholla evolves the fluid properties of thousands of cells simultaneously and can update over 10 million cells per GPU-second while using an exact Riemann solver and PPM reconstruction. Owing to the massively parallel architecture of GPUs and the design of the Cholla code, astrophysical simulations with physically interesting grid resolutions (2563) can easily be computed on a single device. We use the Message Passing Interface library to extend calculations onto multiple devices and demonstrate nearly ideal scaling beyond 64 GPUs. A suite of test problems highlights the physical accuracy of our modeling and provides a useful comparison to other codes. We then use Cholla to simulate the interaction of a shock wave with a gas cloud in the interstellar medium, showing that the evolution of the cloud is highly dependent on its density structure. We reconcile the computed mixing time of a turbulent cloud with a realistic density distribution destroyed by a strong shock with the existing analytic theory for spherical cloud destruction by describing the system in terms of its median gas density.},

	abstract = {In this paper I review three key topics in CFD that have kept researchers busy for half a century. First, the concept of upwind diﬀerencing, evident for 1-D linear advection. Second, its implementation for nonlinear systems in the form of highresolution schemes, now regarded as classical. Third, its genuinely multidimensional implementation in the form of residual-distribution schemes, the most recent addition. This lecture focuses on historical developments; it is not intended as a technical review of methods, hence the lack of formulas and absence of ﬁgures.},

	abstract = {The nonlinear evolution of monochromatic large-amplitude circularly polarized Alfv´en waves subject to the decay instability is studied via numerical simulations in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. The asymptotic value of the cross helicity depends strongly on the plasma beta: in the low beta case multiple decays are observed, with about half of the energy being transferred to waves propagating in the opposite direction at lower wave numbers, for each saturation step. Correspondingly, the other half of the total transverse energy (kinetic and magnetic) goes into energy carried by the daughter compressive waves and to the associated shock heating. In higher beta conditions we ﬁnd instead that the cross helicity decreases monotonically with time towards zero, implying an asymptotic balance between inward and outward Alfv´enic modes, a feature similar to the observed decrease with distance in the solar wind. Although the instability mainly takes place along the propagation direction, in the two and three-dimensional case a turbulent cascade occurs also transverse to the ﬁeld. The asymptotic state of density ﬂuctuations appears to be rather isotropic, whereas a slight preferential cascade in the transverse direction is seen in magnetic ﬁeld spectra. Finally, parametric decay is shown to occur also in a non-periodic domain with open boundaries, when the mother wave is continuously injected from one side. In two and three dimensions a strong transverse ﬁlamentation is found at long times, reminiscent of density ray-like features observed in the extended solar corona and pressure-balanced structures found in solar wind data.},

The numerical method combines high-order quadrature rules in the solution of semi-discrete formulations of hyperbolic conservation laws with the upwind constrained transport (UCT) framework to ensure that the divergence-free constraint of the magnetic ﬁeld is satisﬁed. A novel implementation of UCT that uses the piecewise parabolic method (PPM) for the reconstruction of magnetic ﬁelds at cell corners in 2D is introduced. The resulting scheme can be expressed as the extension of the second-order accurate constrained transport (CT) Godunov-type scheme that is currently used in the Athena astrophysics code. After validating the base algorithm on a series of hydrodynamics test problems, we present the results of multidimensional MHD test problems which demonstrate formal fourth-order convergence for smooth problems, robustness for discontinuous problems, and improved accuracy relative to the second-order scheme.},

The code allows the user to solve a hyperbolic system of partial differential equations with a variety of modern high resolution numerical schemes on 1, 2 or 3D non-uniform Cartesian grids with slab or axial symmetry. The equations may contain fluxes and source terms. The boundary conditions can be chosen from a number of implemented types, --- fixed, periodic, reflective or `free' --- but the code is structured in a manner that allows the user to write his/her own subroutines for a new type of boundary condition, or even to implement a new set of equations. The choice of algorithms allows the user to find the optimal one for the application at hand and/or to compare results of different schemes thus gaining insight into the numerical effects. An emphasis is put on independence of computer platforms. Efficiency of the code is also a high priority, the options available for the user should not compromise the performance.",

Using the adaptive-mesh reﬁnement code ATHENAPK, we conduct simulations of clouds impacted by supersonic and transonic ﬂows with magnetic ﬁelds initially aligned parallel and perpendicular to the ﬂow direction. In cases with isotropic thermal conduction, an evaporative wind forms, stabilizing against instabilities and leading to a mass-loss rate that matches the hydrodynamic case. In anisotropic cases, the impact of conduction is more limited and strongly dependent on the ﬁeld orientation. In runs with initially perpendicular ﬁelds, the ﬁeld lines are folded back into the tail, strongly limiting conduction, but magnetic ﬁelds act to dampen instabilities and slow the stretching of the cloud in the ﬂow direction. In the parallel case, anisotropic conduction aids cloud survival by forming a radiative wind near the front of the cloud, which suppresses instabilities and reduces mass loss. In all cases, anisotropic conduction has a minimal impact on the acceleration of the cloud.},

	abstract = {General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations have revolutionized our understanding of black hole accretion. Here, we present a GPU-accelerated GRMHD code H-AMR with multifaceted optimizations that, collectively, accelerate computation by 2–5 orders of magnitude for a wide range of applications. First, it introduces a spherical grid with 3D adaptive mesh reﬁnement that operates in each of the three dimensions independently. This allows us to circumvent the Courant condition near the polar singularity, which otherwise cripples high-resolution computational performance. Second, we demonstrate that local adaptive time stepping on a logarithmic spherical-polar grid accelerates computation by a factor of 10 compared to traditional hierarchical time-stepping approaches. Jointly, these unique features lead to an effective speed of ∼109 zone cycles per second per node on 5400 NVIDIA V100 GPUs (i.e., 900 nodes of the OLCF Summit supercomputer). We illustrate H-AMRʼs computational performance by presenting the ﬁrst GRMHD simulation of a tilted thin accretion disk threaded by a toroidal magnetic ﬁeld around a rapidly spinning black hole. With an effective resolution of 13,440 × 4608 × 8092 cells and a total of 22 billion cells and ∼0.65 × 108 time steps, it is among the largest astrophysical simulations ever performed. We ﬁnd that frame dragging by the black hole tears up the disk into two independently precessing subdisks. The innermost subdisk rotation axis intermittently aligns with the black hole spin, demonstrating for the ﬁrst time that such long-sought alignment is possible in the absence of large-scale poloidal magnetic ﬁelds.},

Motivated in particular by black hole accretion in the high-accretion-rate, thin-disk regime, we demonstrate the application of the method to this problem.

	abstract = {On the path to exascale the landscape of computer device architectures and corresponding programming models has become much more diverse. While various low-level performance portable programming models are available, support at the application level lacks behind. To address this issue, we present the performance portable block-structured adaptive mesh reﬁnement (AMR) framework PARTHENON, derived from the well-tested and widely used ATHENA++ astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics code, but generalized to serve as the foundation for a variety of downstream multi-physics codes. PARTHENON adopts the KOKKOS programming model, and provides various levels of abstractions from multi-dimensional variables, to packages deﬁning and separating components, to launching of parallel compute kernels. PARTHENON allocates all data in device memory to reduce data movement, supports the logical packing of variables and mesh blocks to reduce kernel launch overhead, and employs one-sided, asynchronous MPI calls to reduce communication overhead in multi-node simulations. Using a hydrodynamics miniapp, we demonstrate weak and strong scaling on various architectures including AMD and NVIDIA GPUs, Intel and AMD x86 CPUs, IBM Power9 CPUs, as well as Fujitsu A64FX CPUs. At the largest scale on Frontier (the ﬁrst TOP500 exascale machine), the miniapp reaches a total of 1.7 × 1013 zone-cycles/s on 9,216 nodes (73,728 logical GPUs) at ≈ 92\% weak scaling parallel efﬁciency (starting from a single node). In combination with being an open, collaborative project, this makes PARTHENON an ideal framework to target exascale simulations in which the downstream developers can focus on their speciﬁc application rather than on the complexity of handling massively-parallel, device-accelerated AMR.},

As a part of this preparation, “real-world” user codes have been selected to help assess the functionality, performance, and usability of the system. This paper describes early experiences using the system in collaboration with the Hamburg Observatory for two selected codes, which have since been adopted in the OLCF Test Harness. Experiences discussed include efforts to resolve performance variability and per-cycle slowdowns. Results are shown for a performance portable astrophysical magnetohydronamics code, AthenaPK, and a mini-application stressing the core functionality of a performance portable block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework, Parthenon-Hydro. These results show good scaling characteristics to the full system.

	abstract = {We discuss an optimal strategy for treating the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) field transport (induction) equation. The induction equation is shown to assume its simplest form when written in terms of the contravariant forms of velocity and magnetic vector density. The approach places the induction equation in integral form and uses the magnetic flux as a fundamental variable. We describe a new numerical technique, called constrained transport (CT), for evolving the induction equation in a way that maintains vanishing divergence of the poloidal (constrained) field components to within machine round-off error. The scheme places no restrictions on the order of accuracy of the transport technique and is shown to work in three dimensions as well as in two. We show that CT allows incorporation of an adaptive mesh algorithm in a natural way. No barrier is evident to prevent the use of the technique in nonideal MHD simulations. Some past treatments of the MHD induction equation are reviewed, with attention to the question of constraint satisfaction. We show how the 3 + 1 formalism of numerical relativity can be used to express the general relativistic MHD equations in a form suitable for numerical evolution. The relativistic form of the magnetic induction equation is then shown to fit naturally within the CT scheme. An axisymmetric, two-dimensional finite-difference code has been constructed incorporating the new method for the induction equation. Results obtained using the CT method are compared with those obtained from a code employing vector potential evolution. Several models involving magnetized flow near a black hole are used as calibrations of the CT scheme.},

In the same way that flux works because you use the exact same flux to remove material from one cell and add it to another EMFs work because each edge field is used twice in each cell, once for each face that touches it.
CT only works if there are no magnetic monopoles initially. Inflow and outflow BCs can also give issues:
“It is worth noting here that the CT scheme only guarantees that field evolution changes are divergence free. If the initial magnetic field fails to satisfy the constraint, it will continue to do so. A more serious issue arises with inflow and outflow boundary conditions. Here one must be careful to not underspecify or overspecify the field and flow at the boundary. Failure to prescribe free-flow boundary conditions properly can lead to subtle inflow of nondivergence-free magnetic field. Because boundary conditions are frequently changed, we recommend that a global measure of the constraint satisfaction, like the example given in § Yh equation (5 6) be monitored as a diagnostic during simulations.” (Evans and Hawley, 1988, p. 666)

Here, we analyse the magnetic ﬁeld in the CGM of the Milky Way-like galaxies simulated as part of the AURIGA project that constitutes a set of high-resolution cosmological magnetohydrodynamical zoom simulations. We show that before z = 1 the CGM becomes magnetized via galactic outﬂows that transport magnetized gas from the disc into the halo. At this time, the magnetization of the CGM closely follows its metal enrichment. We then show that at low redshift an in situ turbulent dynamo that operates on a time-scale of Gigayears further ampliﬁes the magnetic ﬁeld in the CGM and saturates before z = 0. The magnetic ﬁeld strength reaches a typical value of 0.1 μG at the virial radius at z = 0 and becomes mostly uniform within the virial radius. Its Faraday rotation signal is in excellent agreement with recent observations. For most of its evolution, the magnetic ﬁeld in the CGM is an unordered small-scale ﬁeld. Only strong coherent outﬂows at low redshift are able to order the magnetic ﬁeld in parts of the CGM that are directly displaced by these outﬂows.},

Its metallicity dependence plays a key role to determine star formation through the cosmic history. Previous theoretical studies with detailed chemical networks calculate thermal equilibrium states and/or thermal evolution under one-zone collapsing background. The molecular cloud formation in reality, however, involves supersonic flows, and thus resolving the cloud internal turbulence/density structure in three dimension is still essential. We here perform magnetohydrodynamics simulations of 20 km s−1 converging flows of Warm Neutral Medium (WNM) with 1 µG mean magnetic field in the metallicity range from the Solar (1.0 Z⊙) to 0.2 Z⊙ environment. The Cold Neutral Medium (CNM) clumps form faster with higher metallicity due to more efficient cooling. Meanwhile, their mass functions commonly follow dn/dm ∝ m−1.7 at three cooling times regardless of the metallicity. Their total turbulence power also commonly shows the Kolmogorov spectrum with its 80 percent in the solenoidal mode, while the CNM volume alone indicates the transition towards the Larson’s law. These similarities measured at the same time in the unit of the cooling time suggest that the molecular cloud formation directly from the WNM alone requires a longer physical time in a lower metallicity environment in the 1.0–0.2 Z⊙ range. To explain the rapid formation of molecular clouds and subsequent massive star formation possibly within ≲ 10 Myr as observed in the Large/Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC/SMC), the Hi gas already contains CNM volume instead of pure WNM.},

Their structures and properties on macroscale have been interpreted successfully by the generally-accepted two-dimension standard model invoking magnetic reconnection theory as the key energy conversion mechanism. Nevertheless, some momentous dynamical features as discovered by recent high-resolution observations remain elusive. Here, we report a self-consistent high-resolution three-dimension magnetohydrodynamical simulation of turbulent magnetic reconnection within a ﬂare current sheet. It is found that fragmented current patches of diﬀerent scales are spontaneously generated with a well-developed turbulence spectrum at the current sheet, as well as at the ﬂare loop-top region. The close coupling of tearing-mode and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities plays a critical role in developing turbulent reconnection and in forming dynamical structures with synthetic observables in good agreement with realistic observations. The sophisticated modeling makes a paradigm shift from the traditional to three-dimension turbulent reconnection model unifying ﬂare dynamical structures of diﬀerent scales.},

Rotation of the BH drags the surrounding space-time, manifesting as LenseThirring torques that lead to disk precession and warping. We study these processes by simulating a thin (H/r = 0.02), highly tilted (T = 65◦) accretion disk around a rapidly rotating (a = 0.9375) BH at extremely high resolutions, which we performed using the general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) code H-AMR. The disk becomes significantly warped and continuously tears into two individually precessing subdisks. We find that mass accretion rates far exceed the standard α-viscosity expectations. We identify two novel dissipation mechanisms specific to warped disks that are the main drivers of accretion, distinct from the local turbulent stresses that are usually thought to drive accretion. In particular, we identify extreme scale height oscillations that occur twice an orbit throughout our disk. When the scale height compresses, ‘nozzle’ shocks form, dissipating orbital energy and driving accretion. Separate from this phenomenon, there is also extreme dissipation at the location of the tear. This leads to the formation of low-angular momentum ‘streamers’ that rain down onto the inner sub-disk, shocking it. The addition of low angular momentum gas to the inner sub-disk causes it to rapidly accrete, even when it is transiently aligned with the BH spin and thus unwarped. These mechanisms, if general, significantly modify the standard accretion paradigm. Additionally, they may drive structural changes on much shorter timescales than expected in α-disks, potentially explaining some of the extreme variability observed in active galactic nuclei.},

The main conclusions of our approach can be summarized as follows: 1. Turbulence transports the angular momentum radially inward. This effect is more pronounced in the highest resolution calculation. 2. The dominant scale for the magnetic AMT is the smallest spatial scale. 3. The dimensionless magnetic correlation is low in the high-resolution simulation. Thus, chaotic but strong small-scale magnetic fields achieve efficient magnetic AMT.},

	abstract = {Cosmic rays (CRs) are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium (ISM) of nearby galaxies, but many of their properties are not well-constrained. Gamma-ray observations provide a powerful tool in this respect, allowing us to constrain both the interaction of CR protons with the ISM and their transport properties. To help better understand the link between observational signatures and CR physics, we use a series of magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) AREPO simulations of isolated galaxies performed using spectrally-resolved CR transport in every computational cell, with subsequent gamma-ray emission calculated using the CRAYON+ (Cosmic RAY emissiON) code. In each of our simulated halos, modelling the energy-dependent spatial diffusion of CRs leads to a more extended distribution of high-energy ({\textasciitilde}100 GeV) gamma rays compared to that predicted by a 'grey' steady-state model, which is especially visible in the corresponding emission maps and radial profiles. Despite this, the total gamma-ray spectra can often be well approximated by the steady-state model, although recovering the same spectral index typically requires a minor variation of the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient. Our simulations reproduce the observed spectral indices and gamma-ray spectra of nearby star-forming galaxies and also match recent observations of the far infrared--gamma-ray relation. We find, however, that the spectrally resolved model yields marginally smaller luminosities for lower star formation rates compared to grey simulations of CRs. Our work highlights the importance of modelling spectrally resolved CR transport for an accurate prediction of spatially resolved high-energy gamma-ray emission, as will be probed by the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array observatory.},

	abstract = {The theoretical prediction that magnetic reconnection spontaneously drives turbulence has been supported by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and kinetic simulations. While reconnection with externally driven turbulence is accepted as an effective mechanism for particle acceleration, the acceleration during the reconnection with self-driven turbulence is studied for the first time in this work. By using high-resolution 3D MHD simulations of reconnection with self-generated turbulence, we inject test particles into the reconnection layer to study their acceleration process. We find that the energy gain of the particles takes place when they bounce back and forth between converging turbulent magnetic fields. The particles can be efficiently accelerated in self-driven turbulent reconnection with the energy increase by about 3 orders of magnitude in the range of the box size. The acceleration proceeds when the particle gyroradii become larger than the thickness of the reconnection layer. We find that the acceleration in the direction perpendicular to the local magnetic field dominates over that in the parallel direction. The energy spectrum of accelerated particles is time-dependent with a slope that evolves toward -2.5. Our findings can have important implications for particle acceleration in high-energy astrophysical environments.},

	abstract = {We present a first 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of oxygen, neon and carbon shell burning in a rapidly rotating 16 M\_sun core-collapse supernova progenitor. We also run a purely hydrodynamic simulation for comparison. After 180s (15 and 7 convective turnovers respectively), the magnetic fields in the oxygen and neon shells achieve saturation at 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}G and 5 x 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}G. The strong Maxwell stresses become comparable to the radial Reynolds stresses and eventually suppress convection. The suppression of mixing by convection and shear instabilities results in the depletion of fuel at the base of the burning regions, so that the burning shell eventually move outward to cooler regions, thus reducing the energy generation rate. The strong magnetic fields efficiently transport angular momentum outwards, quickly spinning down the rapidly rotating convective oxygen and neon shells and forcing them into rigid rotation. The hydrodynamic model shows complicated redistribution of angular momentum and develops regions of retrograde rotation at the base of the convective shells. We discuss implications of our results for stellar evolution and for the subsequent core-collapse supernova. The rapid redistribution of angular momentum in the MHD model casts some doubt on the possibility of retaining significant core angular momentum for explosions driven by millisecond magnetars. However, findings from multi-D models remain tentative until stellar evolution calculations can provide more consistent rotation profiles and estimates of magnetic field strengths to initialise multi-D simulations without substantial numerical transients. We also stress the need for longer simulations, resolution studies, and an investigation of non-ideal effects.},

We explore a comprehensive range of realistic atmospheres and jet powers and derive dynamic, energetic and polarimetric data which provide insight into what we should expect of future high-resolution studies of AGN outflows. From the simulated synchrotron emission maps which include Doppler beaming we find sidedness distributions that agree well with observations. We replicated a number of findings from our previous work, such as higher power jets inflating larger aspect-ratio lobes and the cluster environment impacting the distribution of energy between the lobe and shocked regions. Comparing UPP and ��-profiles we find that the cluster model chosen results in a different morphology for the resultant lobes with the UPP more able to clear lobe material from the core; and that these different atmospheres influence the ratio between the various forms of energy in the fully developed lobes. This work also highlights the key role played by Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instabilities in the formation of realistic lobe aspect-ratios. Our simulations point to the need for additional lobe-widening mechanisms at high jet powers, for example jet precession. Given that the UPP is our most representative general cluster atmosphere, these numerical simulations represent the most realistic models yet for spherically symmetric atmospheres.},

A time stationary global heliosphere is ﬁrst reproduced by using a high-resolution MHD simulation. Then, motions of a number of test particles (protons) distributed in the virtual heliosphere are numerically solved. When the initial particle Lorentz factor is 10 (∼10 GeV), the motions of particles are strongly affected by smallscale heliospheric structures reﬂecting the small gyroradii of the particles. Particles can enter the heliosphere from many parts (nose, ﬂank, and tail) of the heliopause. Once they have entered, they expand in the region where the magnetic ﬁeld is locally weak, such as the heliopause and the heliospheric current sheet. On the other hand, particles have difﬁculty invading upstream of the termination shock. We found a variety of invading particle trajectory patterns such as current sheet drift, polar drift, spiral motion, shock drift, and Fermi-like acceleration. In the latter two, particles are accelerated. When the initial particle Lorentz factor is 1000 (∼1 TeV), the particles are insensitive to the small-scale structures of the heliosphere due to their large gyroradii. Some particles show eccentric motions due to resonant interaction with the large-scale eddy in the heliotail. Some other particles passing by the heliosphere are mirror reﬂected due to the bottleneck structure of interstellar magnetic ﬁeld surrounding the heliosphere and return back to enter the heliosphere.},

	abstract = {Massive, young stars are the main source of energy that maintains multiphase structure and turbulence in the interstellar medium (ISM), and without this “feedback” the star formation rate (SFR) would be much higher than is observed. Rapid energy loss in the ISM and eﬃcient energy recovery by stellar feedback lead to co-regulation of SFRs and the ISM state. Realistic approaches to this problem should solve for the dynamical evolution of the ISM, including star formation, and the input of feedback energy self-consistently and accurately. Here, we present the TIGRESS-NCR numerical framework, in which UV radiation, supernovae, cooling and heating processes, and gravitational collapse are modeled explicitly. We use an adaptive ray tracing method for UV radiation transfer from star clusters represented by sink particles, accounting for attenuation by dust and gas. We solve photon-driven chemical equations to determine the abundances of H (time-dependent) and C/O-bearing species (steady-state), which then set cooling and heating rates self-consistently. Applying these methods, we present highresolution magnetohydrodynamics simulations of diﬀerentially rotating local galactic disks representing typical conditions of nearby star-forming galaxies. We analyze ISM properties and phase distributions and show good agreement with existing multiwavelength galactic observations. We measure midplane pressure components (turbulent, thermal, and magnetic) and the weight, demonstrating that vertical dynamical equilibrium holds. We quantify the ratios of pressure components to the SFR surface density, which we call the feedback yields. The TIGRESS-NCR framework will allow for a wide range of parameter exploration, including in low metallicity systems.},

However, there is increasing evidence from observational surveys of ‘resolved’ molecular clouds that HCN can trace more diﬀuse gas. We investigate the relationship between gas density and HCN emission through post-processing of high resolution magnetohydrodynamical simulations of cloud-cloud collisions. We ﬁnd that HCN emission traces gas with a mean volumetric density of   3   103 cm 3 and a median visual extinction of   5 mag. We therefore predict a characteristic density that is an order of magnitude less than the “standard” characteristic density of n   3   104 cm 3. Indeed, we ﬁnd in some cases that there is clear HCN emission from the cloud even though there is no gas denser than this standard critical density.

	abstract = {While the importance of supernova feedback in galaxies is well established, its role on the scale of molecular clouds is still debated. In this work, we focus on the impact of supernovae on individual clouds, using a high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamic simulation of a region of 250 pc where we resolve the formation of individual massive stars. The supernova feedback is implemented with real supernovae, meaning supernovae that are the natural evolution of the resolved massive stars, so their position and timing are self-consistent. We select a large sample of molecular clouds from the simulation to investigate the supernova energy injection and the resulting properties of molecular clouds. We ﬁnd that molecular clouds have a lifetime of a few dynamical times, less then half of them contract to the point of becoming gravitationally bound, and the dispersal time of bound clouds of order one dynamical time is a factor of two shorter than that of unbound clouds. We stress the importance of internal supernovae, that is massive stars that explode inside their parent cloud, in setting the cloud dispersal time, and their huge overdensity compared to models where the supernovae are randomly distributed. We also quantify the energy injection eﬃciency of supernovae as a function of supernova distance to the clouds. We conclude that intermittent driving by supernovae can maintain molecular cloud turbulence and may be the main process of cloud dispersal, and that the full role of supernovae in the evolution of molecular clouds cannot be fully accounted for without a self-consistent implementation of the supernova feedback.},

	abstract = {Both observational and theoretical research over the past decade has demonstrated that the probability distribution function (PDF) of the gas density in turbulent molecular clouds is a key ingredient for understanding star formation. It has recently been argued that the PDF of molecular clouds is a pure power-law distribution. It has been claimed that the log-normal part is ruled out when using only the part of the PDF up/down to which it is complete, that is where the column density contours are still closed. By using the results from high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical simulations of molecular cloud formation and evolution, we ﬁnd that the column density PDF is indeed composed of a log-normal and, if including self-gravity, a power-law part. We show that insuﬃcient sampling of a molecular cloud results in closed contours that cut oﬀ the log-normal part. In contrast, systematically increasing the ﬁeld of view and sampling the entire cloud yields a completeness limit at the lower column densities, which also recovers the log-normal part. This demonstrates that the ﬁeld of view must be suﬃciently large for the PDF to be complete down to its log-normal part, which has important implications for predictions of star-formation activity based on the PDF.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07757},
	abstract = {Turbulence in a conducting plasma can amplify seed magnetic fields in what is known as the turbulent, or small-scale, dynamo. The associated growth rate and emergent magnetic-field geometry depend sensitively on the material properties of the plasma, in particular on the Reynolds number \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Re\}\$, the magnetic Reynolds number \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Rm\}\$, and their ratio \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Pm\}{\textbackslash}equiv\{{\textbackslash}rm Rm\}/\{{\textbackslash}rm Re\}\$. For \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Pm\} {\textgreater} 1\$, the amplified magnetic field is gradually arranged into a folded structure, with direction reversals at the resistive scale and field lines curved at the larger scale of the flow. As the mean magnetic energy grows to come into approximate equipartition with the fluid motions, this folded structure is thought to persist. Using analytical theory and high-resolution MHD simulations with the Athena++ code, we show that these magnetic folds become unstable to tearing during the nonlinear stage of the dynamo for \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Rm\}{\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}4\$ and \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Re\}{\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}3\$. An \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Rm\}\$- and \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Pm\}\$-dependent tearing scale, at and below which folds are disrupted, is predicted theoretically and found to match well the characteristic field-reversal scale measured in the simulations. The disruption of folds by tearing increases the ratio of viscous-to-resistive dissipation. In the saturated state, the magnetic-energy spectrum exhibits a sub-tearing-scale steepening to a slope consistent with that predicted for tearing-mediated Alfv{\textbackslash}'enic turbulence. Its spectral peak appears to be independent of the resistive scale and comparable to the driving scale of the flow, while the magnetic energy resides in a broad range of scales extending down to the field-reversal scale set by tearing. Emergence of a degree of large-scale magnetic coherence in the saturated state of the turbulent dynamo may be consistent with observations of magnetic-field fluctuations in galaxy clusters and recent laboratory experiments.},

We ﬁnd that the ampliﬁcation histories, saturation values, and morphologies of the magnetic ﬁelds vary considerably depending on the baryonic physics employed, primarily because of differences in the gas density distribution. In particular, adiabatic runs and runs with a sub-grid (effective equation of state) stellar feedback model yield lower saturation values and morphologies that exhibit greater large-scale order compared with runs that adopt explicit stellar feedback and runs with cooling and star formation but no feedback. The discrepancies mostly lie in gas denser than the galactic average, which requires cooling and explicit fragmentation to capture. Independent of the baryonic physics included, the magnetic ﬁeld strength scales with gas density as B ∝ n2/3, suggesting isotropic ﬂux freezing or equipartition between the magnetic and gravitational energies during the ﬁeld ampliﬁcation. We conclude that accurate treatments of cooling, star formation, and stellar feedback are crucial for obtaining the correct magnetic ﬁeld strength and morphology in dense gas, which, in turn, is essential for properly modeling other physical processes that depend on the magnetic ﬁeld, such as cosmic ray feedback.},

	abstract = {Arkenstone is a new model for multiphase, stellar feedback driven galactic winds designed for inclusion in coarse resolution cosmological simulations. In this ﬁrst paper of a series, we describe the features that allow Arkenstone to properly treat high speciﬁc energy wind components and demonstrate them using idealised non-cosmological simulations of a galaxy with a realistic CGM, using the Arepo code. Hot, fast gas phases with low mass loadings are predicted to dominate the energy content of multiphase outﬂows. In order to treat the huge dynamic range of spatial scales involved in cosmological galaxy formation at feasible computational expense, cosmological volume simulations typically employ a Lagrangian code or else use adaptive mesh reﬁnement with a quasi-Lagrangian reﬁnement strategy. However, it is diﬃcult to inject a high speciﬁc energy wind in a Lagrangian scheme without incurring artiﬁcial burstiness. Additionally, the low densities inherent to this type of ﬂow result in poor spatial resolution. Arkenstone addresses these issues with a novel scheme for coupling energy into the ISM/CGM transition region which also provides the necessary level of reﬁnement at the base of the wind. In the absence of our improvements, we show that poor spatial resolution near the sonic point of a hot, fast outﬂow leads to an underestimation of gas acceleration as the wind propagates. We explore the diﬀerent mechanisms by which low and high speciﬁc energy winds can regulate the SFR of galaxies. In future work, we will demonstrate other aspects of the Arkenstone model.},

We investigate the contribution of satellite galaxies to the cold gas budget in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of a Milky Way-like host galaxy. We perform controlled experiments with three different satellite mass distributions and identify several mechanisms by which satellites can add cold gas to the CGM, including ram pressure stripping and induced cooling in the mixing layer of the stripped cold gas. These two mechanisms contribute a comparable amount of cold gas to the host CGM. We find that the less massive satellites (⩽ 109M⊙) not only lose all of their cold gas in a short period (∼ 0.5-1 Gyr), but their stripped cold clouds also mix with the hot CGM gas and get heated up quickly. However, stellar feedback from these less massive satellites can hugely alter the fate of their stripped gas. Feedback speeds up the destruction of the stripped cold clouds from these satellites by making them more diffuse with more surface area. On the other hand, the more massive satellites (LMC or SMC-like ∼ 1010M⊙) can add cold gas to the total gas budget of the host CGM for several Gyrs.},

We use novel analysis methods to measure the cooling rate, the heating rate associated with multiple mechanisms, and the power associated with adiabatic compression/expansion. A signiﬁcant reduction of the cooling rate and cooling ﬂow within 20 kpc from the centre can be achieved with kinetic jets. However, at larger scales and away from the jet axis, the system relaxes to a cooling ﬂow conﬁguration. Jet feedback is anisotropic and is mostly distributed along the jet axis, where the cooling rate is reduced and a signiﬁcant fraction of the jet power is converted into kinetic power of heated outﬂowing gas. Away from the jet axis weak shock heating represents the dominant heating source. Turbulent heating is signiﬁcant only near the cluster centre, but it becomes inefﬁcient at ∼50 kpc scales where it only represents a few per cent of the total heating rate. Several details of the simulations depend on the choice made for the hydro solver, a consequence of the difﬁculty of achieving proper numerical convergence for this problem: current physics implementations and resolutions do not properly capture multiphase gas that develops as a consequence of thermal instability. These processes happen at the grid scale and leave numerical solutions sensitive to the properties of the chosen hydro solver.},

We ﬁnd that SNe launch highly supersonic winds with properties that agree reasonably well with expectations from analytic models. The energy loading (ηE = E˙ wind/E˙ SN) of the winds in our simulations are well converged with spatial resolution while the wind mass loading (ηM = M˙ wind/M˙  ) decreases with resolution at the resolutions we achieve. We present a simple analytic model based on the concept that SNRs with cooling radii greater than the local scaleheight break out of the disc and power the wind. This model successfully explains the dependence (or lack thereof) of ηE (and by extension ηM) on the gas surface density, star formation efﬁciency, disc radius and the clustering of SNe. The winds our simulations are weaker than expected in reality, likely due to the fact that we seed SNe preferentially at density peaks. Clustering SNe in time and space substantially increases the wind power.},

Our analysis includes three disc models with gas surface densities ranging from Milky Way-like galaxies to gas-rich ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), and two different SN driving schemes (random and correlated with local gas density). In order to isolate the physics of SN feedback, we do not include additional feedback processes. We ﬁnd that, in these local box calculations, SN feedback excites relatively low mass-weighted gas turbulent velocity dispersions ≈3–7 km s−1 and low wind mass loading factors η   1 in all the cases we study. The low turbulent velocities and wind mass loading factors predicted by our local box calculations are signiﬁcantly below those suggested by observations of gas-rich and rapidly star-forming galaxies; they are also in tension with global simulations of disc galaxies regulated by stellar feedback. Using a combination of numerical tests and analytic arguments, we argue that local Cartesian boxes cannot predict the properties of galactic winds because they do not capture the correct global geometry and gravitational potential of galaxies. The wind mass loading factors are in fact not well deﬁned in local simulations because they decline signiﬁcantly with increasing box height. More physically realistic calculations (e.g. including a global galactic potential and disc rotation) will likely be needed to fully understand disc turbulence and galactic outﬂows, even for the idealized case of feedback by SNe alone.},

	abstract = {Faraday rotation is one of the most widely used observables to infer the strength and conﬁguration of the magnetic ﬁeld in the ionized gas of the Milky Way and nearby spiral galaxies. Here, we compute synthetic Faraday rotation maps at z = 0 for a set of disc galaxies from the Auriga high-resolution cosmological simulations, for different observer positions within and outside the galaxy. We ﬁnd that the strength of the Faraday rotation of our simulated galaxies for a hypothetic observer at the solar circle is broadly consistent with the Faraday rotation seen for the Milky Way. The same holds for an observer outside the galaxy and the observed signal of the nearby spiral galaxy M51. However, we also ﬁnd that the structure and angular power spectra of the synthetic all-sky Faraday rotation maps vary strongly with azimuthal position along the solar circle. We argue that this variation is a result of the structure of the magnetic ﬁeld of the galaxy that is dominated by an azimuthal magnetic ﬁeld ordered scales of several kpc, but has radial and vertical magnetic ﬁeld components that are only ordered on scales of 1–2 kpc. Because the magnetic ﬁeld strength decreases exponentially with height above the disc, the Faraday rotation for an observer at the solar circle is dominated by the local environment. This represents a severe obstacle for attempts to reconstruct the global magnetic ﬁeld of the Milky Way from Faraday rotation maps alone without including additional observables.},

	abstract = {Methods. We employed numerical models of isolated, star-forming spiral galaxies that include a magnetized gaseous disk, a dark matter halo, stars, and stellar feedback. Naturally, the resulting magnetic ﬁeld has a complex morphology that includes a strong random component. Using a smoothing of the magnetic ﬁeld on small scales, we were able to separate the mean from the turbulent component and analyze them individually.
Results. We ﬁnd that a mean-ﬁeld dynamo naturally occurs as a result of the dynamical evolution of the galaxy and ampliﬁes the magnetic ﬁeld by an order of magnitude over half a Gyr. Despite the highly dynamical nature of these models, the morphology of the mean component of the ﬁeld is identical to analytical predictions.
Conclusions. This result underlines the importance of the mean-ﬁeld dynamo in galactic evolution. Moreover, by demonstrating the natural growth of the magnetic ﬁeld in a complex galactic environment, it brings us a step closer to understanding the cosmic origin of magnetic ﬁelds.},

	abstract = {Magnetic ﬁelds are known to be dynamically important in the interstellar medium of our own Galaxy, and they are ubiquitously observed in diffuse gas in the haloes of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Yet, magnetic ﬁelds have typically been neglected in studies of the formation of galaxies, leaving their global inﬂuence on galaxy formation largely unclear. Here we extend our magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) implementation in the moving-mesh code AREPO to cosmological problems which include radiative cooling and the formation of stars. In particular, we replace our previously employed divergence cleaning approach with a Powell eight-wave scheme, which turns out to be signiﬁcantly more stable, even in very dynamic environments. We verify the improved accuracy through simulations of the magnetorotational instability in accretion discs, which reproduce the correct linear growth rate of the instability. Using this new MHD code, we simulate the formation of isolated disc galaxies similar to the Milky Way using idealized initial conditions with and without magnetic ﬁelds. We ﬁnd that the magnetic ﬁeld strength is quickly ampliﬁed in the initial central starburst and the differential rotation of the forming disc, eventually reaching a saturation value. At this point, the magnetic ﬁeld pressure in the interstellar medium becomes comparable to the thermal pressure, and a further efﬁcient growth of the magnetic ﬁeld strength is prevented. The additional pressure component leads to a lower star formation rate at late times compared to simulations without magnetic ﬁelds, and induces changes in the spiral arm structures of the gas disc. In addition, we observe highly magnetized fountain-like outﬂows from the disc. These results are robust with numerical resolution and are largely independent of the initial magnetic seed ﬁeld strength assumed in the initial conditions, as the ampliﬁcation process is rapid and self-regulated. Our ﬁndings suggest an important inﬂuence of magnetic ﬁelds on galaxy formation and evolution, cautioning against their neglect in theoretical models of structure formation.},

	abstract = {The magnetic ﬁelds observed in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies appear to be in equipartition with the turbulent, thermal and cosmic ray energy densities, and hence are expected to be dynamically important. However, the origin of these strong magnetic ﬁelds is still unclear, and most previous attempts to simulate galaxy formation from cosmological initial conditions have ignored them altogether. Here, we analyse the magnetic ﬁelds predicted by the simulations of the Auriga Project, a set of 30 high-resolution cosmological zoom simulations of Milky Way like galaxies, carried out with a moving-mesh magnetohydrodynamics code and a detailed galaxy formation physics model. We ﬁnd that the magnetic ﬁelds grow exponentially at early times owing to a small-scale dynamo with an e-folding time of roughly 100 Myr in the centre of haloes until saturation occurs around z = 2–3, when the magnetic energy density reaches about 10 per cent of the turbulent energy density with a typical strength of 10–50 µG. In the galactic centres, the ratio between magnetic and turbulent energies remains nearly constant until z = 0. At larger radii, differential rotation in the discs leads to linear ampliﬁcation that typically saturates around z = 0.5–0. The ﬁnal radial and vertical variations of the magnetic ﬁeld strength can be well described by two joint exponential proﬁles, and are in good agreement with observational constraints. Overall, the magnetic ﬁelds have only little effect on the global evolution of the galaxies as it takes too long to reach equipartition. We also demonstrate that our results are well converged with numerical resolution.},

We use three diﬀerent galaxy formation models, each with and without magnetic ﬁelds, and include additional spatial reﬁnement in the CGM to improve its resolution. The central galaxy’s star formation rate and stellar mass are not strongly aﬀected by the presence of magnetic ﬁelds, but the galaxy is more disc-dominated and its central black hole is more massive when �� {\textgreater} 0. The physical properties of the CGM change signiﬁcantly. With magnetic ﬁelds, the circumgalactic gas ﬂows are slower, the atomic hydrogen-dominated extended discs around the galaxy are more massive and the densities in the inner CGM are therefore higher, the temperatures in the outer CGM are higher, and the pressure in the halo is higher and smoother. The total gas fraction and metal mass fraction in the halo are also higher when magnetic ﬁelds are included, because less gas escapes the halo. Additionally, we ﬁnd that the CGM properties depend on azimuthal angle and that magnetic ﬁelds reduce the scatter in radial velocity, whilst enhancing the scatter in metallicity at ﬁxed azimuthal angle. The metals are thus less well-mixed throughout the halo, resulting in more metal-poor halo gas. These results together show that magnetic ﬁelds in the CGM change the ﬂow of gas in galaxy haloes, making it more diﬃcult for metal-rich outﬂows to mix with the metal-poor CGM and to escape the halo, and therefore should be included in simulations of galaxy formation.},

These were carried out with the moving mesh code AREPO, together with a comprehensive model for galaxy formation physics, including active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback and magnetic ﬁelds, which produces realistic galaxy populations in large cosmological simulations. We demonstrate that our simulations reproduce a wide range of present-day observables, in particular, two-component disc-dominated galaxies with appropriate stellar masses, sizes, rotation curves, star formation rates and metallicities. We investigate the driving mechanisms that set present-day disc sizes/scalelengths, and ﬁnd that they are related to the angular momentum of halo material. We show that the largest discs are produced by quiescent mergers that inspiral into the galaxy and deposit high-angular momentum material into the pre-existing disc, simultaneously increasing the spin of dark matter and gas in the halo. More violent mergers and strong AGN feedback play roles in limiting disc size by destroying pre-existing discs and by suppressing gas accretion on to the outer disc, respectively. The most important factor that leads to compact discs, however, is simply a low angular momentum for the halo. In these cases, AGN feedback plays an important role in limiting central star formation and the formation of a massive bulge.},
