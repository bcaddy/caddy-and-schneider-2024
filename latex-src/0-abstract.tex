% S1: What are we presenting?
We present an extension of the massively parallel, GPU native, astrophysical hydrodynamics code Cholla to magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).
% S2: Which equations and methods?
Cholla solves the ideal MHD equations in their Eulerian form on a static Cartesian mesh utilizing the Van Leer + Constrained Transport integrator, the HLLD Riemann solver, and reconstruction methods at second and third order.
% S3: Performance results
Cholla's MHD module can perform over 200 million cell updates per GPU-second while using the HLLD Riemann solver and second order reconstruction.
% S4: How big of a grid can we do per GPU?
The massively parallel nature of GPUs allow Cholla's MHD module to perform simulation with resolutions of $>450^3$ cells on a single GPU.
% S5: Scaling
We use GPU direct MPI to attain nearly perfect weak scaling on up to 74,000 GPUs while simulating a total grid size of over 1.2 trillion cells.
% S6: We did test problems
A suite of test problems highlights the accuracy of Cholla's MHD module and demonstrates the zero magnetic divergence character of solutions, which is maintained to round off error.
% S7: Summary of new testing framework
We also present new testing and continuous integration tools for Cholla that utilize GoogleTest, GitHub Actions, and Jenkins.
% S8: Why Testing?
These new tools have allowed us to significantly increase our rate of development while making Cholla more robust and accurate.
