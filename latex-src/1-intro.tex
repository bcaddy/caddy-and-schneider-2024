\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

- why do big sims matter?
  - esp fast efficient MHD codes
  - what kinds of sims?
    - giant turbulent boxes, mhd outflows of galaxies
- why this code? 
  - why a new code? Cholla is fast, scales well, GPUs are fast, all big new computers are gpu based
  - finite volume + CT, what other methods? Why is divergence cleaning bad
  - cite lots of other codes and why is our code different
  - why do we use this framework, what other options are there
  - we have a testing framework that allows for scalable development, makes it easier and faster to dev since they don't have to worry about breaking other peoples stuff
- outline paper
  - alude to performance and testing at scale
